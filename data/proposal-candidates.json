          "description": "# Nouns Esports 2024\n\nAuthored by [Sasquatch](https://twitter.com/PartSasquatch), [Peter](https://twitter.com/peterpandam), [Brennen](https://twitter.com/brennen_eth), and [Gatsby](https://twitter.com/gubsby), with contributions from the broader Nouns Esports community.\n\n## TLDR\nNouns has established itself in tier-one esports competition. Let's keep the momentum going! This is our opportunity to become a globally recognized legacy brand in esports.\n\n\n- **Dota 2:** The highest placing North American team, achieving an impressive 7th place at The International 12 this October.\n- **Counter-Strike 2:** The #2 ranked team across North America.\n- **Super Smash Bros. Melee:** Our player is now ranked among the global top 10.\n- **And More!** Exciting initiatives and fan-favorite teams in Pokémon UNITE and Brawl Stars.\n​\n\n---\n\n### **Re-Introducing Nouns Esports**\n\nWe’re **Nouns Esports.** A tier-one esports organization on a quest to disrupt esports one victory at a time while proliferating Nouns across the competitive gaming space in all sorts of unique, engaging, and nounish ways. It all started with **[Prop 68](https://nouns.wtf/vote/68)**, where we picked up our first team and since then we’ve seen tremendous growth and success, now competing at the highest level in numerous esports.\n\nWe’ve had a crazy journey so far, and now that we’ve established Nouns within the esports ecosystem we want to double down and make 2024 the year that Nouns Esports becomes a globally recognized legacy brand.\n\nWant a quick look at what we do? Check out the short documentary **[“A New Model”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAXzMQ8pPvE)** by our friends over at [nounish](https://twitter.com/nounish).\n\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkQ5q1vQa.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAXzMQ8pPvE)\n\n---\n### **Dota 2**\n\nOur story begins in early 2022 when Nouns Esports jumped into an outsized opportunity by signing Dota’s 3rd/4th best North American team. Our goal was to give these players the top-level support needed to hone their skills to become contenders at The International. \n\nThe International is Dota 2's most prestigious event, bringing together the best 20 teams from across the globe to compete on one stage for millions of dollars, and this year we not only qualified for the event, but we turned heads and finished in 7th place as the highest ranked NA team in the past 4 years.\n\n![Walkout Gif](https://i.postimg.cc/kGhdSX9X/2e2-Image-Box-1.gif)\n\nOne of our highlights of the tournament was beating the reigning TI champions, Tundra Esports, in a series peaking at **903,210** concurrent viewers.\n\n![Adidas Jerseys](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJad9yD7T.png)\n\nDota 2 is known for its open ecosystem which fosters brand and business incubation. Unlike other publishers, Valve adopts an open approach toward IP rights, making it a ripe frontier for brand proliferation. Nouns already have numerous permanent assets within Dota and will continue to get more with each season that we support a top team.\n\n![In-Game Items](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Syt8egum6.png)\n\nBuilding upon our success of last season, we want to assemble a roster capable of being not only the best in North America but the world. Top 8 at TI was a great accomplishment, but now we're aiming higher and want to leverage our better positioning within esports to target more ambitious achievements in 2024.\n\nWe're committed to putting our players first and are proud to take an industry leading **0% of prize money** from any of our teams. Our in-game success is imperative to proliferating Nouns across esports so we always want to incentivize consistent top-level performance from our players.\n\n![TI Placement and Prize Money](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1zZ_9qXa.png)\n\nOur contribution to the post-TI roster shuffle excitement was met with tons of community hype for our announcement of Nouns veterans Gunnar and Lelis returning to the roster and the new addition of Dota 2 legend, Tal \"Fly\" Aizik.\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1NV39bEa.png)](https://twitter.com/nounsesports/status/1723772464180650436?s=20)\n\n---\n\n\n### **Counter-Strike 2**\n\nIn September of last year, we picked up an unsponsored CS Team that was left astray by their previous organization right before an important planned bootcamp and together we built and supported the roster into becoming one of the region's best teams. Our team's record in CS2 is an impressive **13W-2L** so far, and is [**ranked #2 in all of NA**](https://www.dust2.us/news/41188/nouns-unjustified-jump-up-in-dust2us-november-2023-rankings).\n\n![CS2 Players](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkDBhAwQ6.png)\n\nSince its inception, our CS squad has qualified for numerous top-tier events around the globe:\n- **USA**  —  IEM Dallas 2023\n- **SWEDEN**  —  IEM Road to Rio RMR 2022\n- **MEXICO**  —  Paris Major RMR 2023\n- **SERBIA**  —  CCT Online Finals #2\n- **POLAND**  —  Thunderpick World Championship\n- **SWEDEN**  —  ESL Challenger Jonkoping 2023\n\nOur goal is to immortalize the Noggles within CS. By qualifying for a Major, we secure the right to have our own in-game stickers, which generate significant revenue and brand proliferation.\n\n![Sticker Preview](https://i.postimg.cc/pLSLgtmj/dfsdf-Image-Box-1.gif)\n\nCS2 was recently released this September and is currently seeing an all-time high in player count, with an active user base of over 40 million people in the last month and millions logging in daily. \n\nIn the esports world, when a new game drops it creates opportunities for new players to out-hustle the previously established professionals. We are optimistic that our current positioning in CS2 could lead to significant growth of Nouns Esports revenue streams and brand awareness.\n\n---\n\n\n### **Super Smash Bros Melee**\n\nAklo, a rising star in the competitive Smash scene, now ranks in the top 10 on the global stage. Our relationship with Aklo has strengthened since we recruited him last year. His growing enthusiasm for our vision has motivated him to take on a greater role within the organization. Not only will Aklo represent us in Smash competitions around the world he will also be a strong advocate and leader of our Prop House initiatives.\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByRYnYbNp.png)](https://liquipedia.net/smash/Aklo)\n\nThe community's enthusiasm has enabled its continued growth two decades after the game's release solidifying its standing as a paragon of esports. Smash boasts one of the most extensive fighting game communities, with a broad array of local events in numerous major cities, creating an aura of invincibility reminiscent of 'Fight Club'(without the explosions). Smash is here to stay, and our goal is to expand our presence within this dynamic community through Prop House for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhile several organizations in the community direct funds towards events, none match our level of openness. Prop House stands out with its competitive edge, offering complete transparency in funding and proposal specifics. This transparency is precisely why we see Prop House as a future mainstay in the Smash Esports ecosystem.\n\n---\n\n\n### **Prop House**\n\nWith [Prop 119](https://nouns.wtf/vote/119) we experimented with two Esport Prop House Rounds,\n- One that supporters players competing at esports events\n- Another that supports event operators hosting local tournaments\n\nWe were incredibly satisfied with this pilot which is why we aim to expand & grow this part of our initiative.\n\nFor 2024, we'd like to engage the esports community further in governance. We have three rounds in mind that would be compelling to our audience.\n\n**Round 1:** For players seeking support to represent Nouns Esports in esports competitions\n**Round 2:** For tournaments seeking the support of Nouns to help fund their events\n**Round 3:** For content creators who create content about our Esport teams and players\n\n**Previously Supported Events**\nGalint Melee Open 2023 - [**prop.house**](https://prop.house/nouns-esports/tournaments/8260)\nTipped Off 14 - [**prop.house**](https://prop.house/nouns-esports/tournaments/5985)\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJ0q99q7p.png)](https://prop.house/nouns-esports/tournaments/5985)\n\n---\n\n### **Nouns Esports Pass**\n\n[![](https://i.postimg.cc/y8v6hLrp/Asse3t-1-2.gif)](https://nouns.gg)\n\nBridging the gap between gaming and web3 has always been a tall order, however, we have been incubating an interactive tool for fans to solve this problem. Currently, [nouns.gg](https://nouns.gg) is a static website that provides information about upcoming matches, rosters, and important links. Over the last 6 months, it has served nearly 10k unique visitors and over 20k page views with about 30% of the traffic being raw Google searches. We want to take our website to the next level by transitioning it into a fully interactive web-app that over time will become a hub for all things Nouns Esports. \n\nThe Nouns Esports Pass will be the first of many onchain experiences we provide for our community. It will serve as a gamified \"passport\" to a community member's journey through Nouns Esports allowing them to collect badges for attending events, level up, claim rewards, and show support to their favorite teams. The Nouns Esports Pass is being designed from the ground up to support an entirely onchain experience that is accessible to anyone, crypto native or not. We aim to achieve this by leveraging recent and upcoming tech such as [Smart Wallets](https://cointelegraph.com/learn/account-abstraction-guide-to-ethereums-erc-4337-standard) and [Passkeys](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7212). These advancements will allow us to design an experience where the user doesn't have to interact with wallet popups, gas fees, or seedphrases all the while not sacrificing the web3 values and primitives Nouns are rooted in. \n\nUltimately, the Nouns Esports web-app will serve as a platform that we can leverage to continually innovate and provide new and exciting experiences for our community.\n\n---\n\n\n### **Nouns Esports League (NEL)**\n\nThe [North American Dota Challenger's League](https://twitter.com/NADotaEsports) (NADCL) will rebrand as the ‘Nouns Esports League’ (NEL).\n\nThe NEL will be led by [Peterpandam](https://twitter.com/Peterpandam), a TI champion and pod member at Nouns Esports since [Prop 119](https://nouns.wtf/vote/119) in August 2022. His expertise in the Dota scene makes him an invaluable asset in steering the league toward new heights. We believe that the NEL has significant potential for growth and can become the most popular non-professional league in all of Dota.\n\nIn an effort to integrate the Nouns community more closely with the NEL, all Nouns Season Pass holders will be granted complimentary access to all NEL events. This initiative is designed to attract a more engaged fan base to Nouns Esports. \n\n\n---\n\n\n### **Additional Initiatives**\n\nAt Nouns Esports we’re always evolving and exploring different ways to reach a wider and more diverse audience, from competitive teams to content creators, our flexibility allows us to more easily bring nouns around the globe to a wide range of communities.\n\n![csImage Box](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1S5pj9X6.png)\n\nFrom the great success we've had in Europe with our [Pokemon UNITE division](https://liquipedia.net/pokemon/Nouns_Esports), to our brand new [Brawl Stars team](https://liquipedia.net/brawlstars/Nouns_Esports) from Brazil, more and more people are learning about Nouns through esports every day.\n\nWhile we continue to focus mainly on our larger initiatives, we have big ideas for 2024 and plan to continue experimenting and trying out new things to further grow the Nouns Esports fanbase.\n\n---\n\n\n# **Goals for 2024**\n\n![Fans Wearing Noggles](https://i.postimg.cc/bYbWbL6x/Assfet-1-2.gif)\n\n- **Brand Awareness**\n    - Noggles are on a path to becoming iconic within esports\n    - Competitive Success drives awareness of how Nouns operates\n​\n- **Elevated Partnerships**\n    - Adidas\n        - As our first partner outside of Nouns, Adidas was our apparel sponsor for The International 2023. Nouns community member [Benjamin](https://twitter.com/benjaminlatsko) has brought this partnership to Nouns Esports and will continue his efforts of leading on the relationship. For the upcoming season, we hope to further collaborate\n![adidas](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkpnrFZ4T.png)\n    - Two or more financial partners\n        - Targeting partners who resonate with our brand ethos\n        - Our competitive success has shifted the dynamics in our favor, attracting partners rather than us seeking them out\n​\n- **Expand Onchain Experiences**\n    - Transition our static website to a fully interactive webapp\n    - Deploy infrastructure that allows non crypto natives to participate in these onchain experiences\n    - Moments\n        - Structured and more frequent open edition mints that capture our esports success throughout the year\n    - Nouns Esports Pass\n        - An onchain experience designed from the ground up to engage with all of our fans, crypto native or not\n​\n- **Operating as a Non Profit Org**\n    - Aligned with our vision\n    - We don't need stakeholders\n    - This is another opportunity to innovate within Esports\n​\n- **Merchandise**\n    - At TI we sold thousands of dollars of product\n        - Distributed thousands of Noggles\n           ![Noggles Gif](https://i.postimg.cc/02KHkFht/rfframe2-1.gif)\n        - Video clip at Convention Center of people wearing Noggles\n    - Collaborated with Nounish Artists\n        - Sold a varied set of items from shirts to hats to branded chocolate\n            ![MerchGif](https://i.postimg.cc/kMLzr7D1/fsqqq-1-1.gif)\n\n---\n\n\n### **Budget**\n\n**2,312,500 USDC for 2024**\n\nThe budget increase for Nouns Esports is a strategic move to match the rising stock of our team and players in a competitive market. Higher player salaries are essential to retain top talent against other organizations' offers. We're also introducing structured payments for support staff to ensure steady operations year-round, an aspect previously under-budgeted. \n\n**Breakdown:**\n- **Player/Coach Salaries** -  1,254,000 USDC\n    - Salaries increased to match market rates of our new & existing talent\n​\n- **Support Staff** - 549,500 USDC\n    - First time we are paying the core team full-time rates\n        - General Manager, Content Manager, Developer, Player Manager, Project Manager, Graphic Designer, & Wellness Support\n​\n- **Operational Expenses** - 329,000 USDC\n    - Travel, Equipment, and other miscellaneous costs.\n​\n- **Nouns Esports League** - 90,000 USDC\n    - Three Seasons, 60% going directly to the prizepool.\n​\n- **Prop House** - 90,000 USDC\n    - Three rounds supporting players, tournaments, and content creators.\n\n**Why an annual budget?**\n- This is the typical term of operations within esports. This is what players expect and given the nature of the competitive landscape, what makes sense.\n\n---\n\n\n### **Org Structure**\n\nThese are the roles we expect to staff for the 2024 season. We'd like to work with the same core team that we used during our run at The International 12.\n- **General Manager**\n    - Business Development & Strategy\n        - Organizational Direction\n        - Partnerships\n        - Merch Fulfillment\n​\n- **Player Management**\n    - Manage Player Schedules, Travel, and Accommodations \n    - Interface with Tournament Operators\n    - Assist players with meeting sponsor deliverables \n​\n- **Social Media/Content**\n    - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nounsesports), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nouns_esports/), [Farcaster](https://warpcast.com/esports), [Tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/@nounsesports), [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@nounsesports)\n        - Thus far Twitter has been our primary social platform. This year we will make an effort to grow all of the aforementioned channels.\n    - Types of Content:\n        - Shoot video content at live events\n        - Clipping online broadcasts\n        - Producing content pieces with compelling narratives\n            [![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hyf1favm6.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiyCyDcVIHg) \n​\n- **Dev Team**\n    - Maintain and build [nouns.gg](https://nouns.gg)\n    - Capture significant moments as open edition mints\n    - Build and launch the Nouns Esports Pass\n​\n- **Wellness Support**\n    - We brought in top-tier esports wellness support earlier this year and both teams saw significant improvement in results.\n    - Health and wellness practices\n    - Fosters strong interpersonal relationships\n    - Introduces stress management techniques\n    - Nurtures team dynamics\n    - Esports Community appreciates these efforts as it shows we care for player well-being\n\n---\n\n\n### **Multisig**\nWe will be using the same multisig that was created for Proposal [119](https://nouns.wtf/vote/119) & [263](https://nouns.wtf/vote/263) consisting of Nouners and Nounsfolk. We will be adding Nouns community member [Sam](https://twitter.com/SamScolari) to the signers list, making our multisig 3/6.\n\n- Sasquatch\n- Brennen\n- Maty\n- Oni\n- Peter\n- Sam\n",

          "description": "# Index the Noun Hunter\n\n**Disclaimer: Nobody asked me to put this prop up, it just makes sense to me.**\n\nIndex is running an experiment in throwing weight behind zero weight votes with reason (via zeroweight.eth) and Noun 747 is the perfect Noun to be used in this experiment. The process is currently manual with rumours of an automated solution in development.\n\n**Why do this?**\n\n- This empowers individuals looking to participate as a zero weight voter\n- Noun 747 is then pretty much guaranteed to not be sold or dilute \"BV\" etc\n- Index card is arguably one of the most valuable memes within the Nouns experiment and we should provide the tools needed to grow the meme\n\nI believe Index to be a special one-off case and I don't see a similar scenario appearing again anytime soon, therefore I am including the \"Verbs bonus\" of 16e to cover any unforeseen expenditure and as retro/future compensation for 24/7 participation (suspected neural-implant of the Nouns DAO), acting as a money lender for those in need and being a much needed source of humour and memes whilst exhibiting commitment to a lifetime of servitude at the DAO.\n\n**FAQ**\nQ: Why would we give index another Noun, as we just gifted Noun 809?\nA: This is a totally separate scenario and the Noun will instantly become an active voter giving an entirely new and different perspective to that of Index/Nouns 809 & 487\nQ: Why don't we just delegate the noun?\nA: This adds a layer of (imo unnecessary) complexity to achieve the same result\n\n**zeroweight.eth** - let's make this happen:\n![zero weight](https://raw.seadn.io/files/e3e0406f5f43700c100108e90865cca9.svg)",

          "description": "# Gift a Noun to Nounish Founders: wiz\n\n**tl;dr - Honor early founders of nounish communities: wiz**\n\nThis is the first of a set of proposals to gift Nouns to the founders of the first three Nouns forks who proliferated Nouns via unique iterations of nounish DAOs which evolved into the largest nounish communities today.\n\nI feel the reputation of these founders precedes them, so I'll be brief. These three founders were very early builders in the Nouns ecosystem, without them the most active nounish communities today would not exist. Not only were they behind the earliest iterations of the Nouns auction and DAO structure, they have continued to contribute to the ecosystem as time has gone on.\n\nAs devoted builders in the nouniverse, they have proven their value and alignment with the DAO and would be ideal candidates to receive Nouns. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyYinN_M6.png)\n[*Source (h/t MikeGood, Lil Nouner)*](https://twitter.com/GoodBeats/status/1706019634246213811)\n\nThese communities **far** exceed the size of the community of Nouners.

Pull audit funds back to the USDC payer contract.\n\n## Description\n\nThe original burn design was meant to mitigate the arb in the short term, and it did so by burning BV in excess of recent auction prices immediately, with no delay.\n\nThe spec changed to give voters more coordination time, and that led to the burn no longer mitigating short term arb.\n\nWe spent time discussing additional changes to combine with the burn, e.g. require noun age to fork, and decided it’s all too complex and the problem can be solved with existing tools.\n\nWe wrote [the arb analysis post](https://mirror.xyz/verbsteam.eth/W4gaOrp6NC6jopc6vGsGuhz3o4ej0G_0TFhBlcLed94) after this realization, hoping to provide voters with a framework on how to take action with protocol as it currently is.\n\nSince the burn in its current spec doesn’t solve the arb and seems to have lost some consensus and momentum, we suggest dropping it at least until the current arb problem is dramatically mitigated, i.e. BV is equal-ish to natural demand.\n\nOnce we’re in that reality we can revisit the value of adding the burn and certainly do so if there’s enough energy behind it!\n\n## Transaction\n\nWithdraw the audit funds from the Tech Grants multisig back to the Payer contract, which is where the DAO holds USDC to fund proposals.\n\n## Summary\n\nPlease signal if you agree/disagree and articulate your thoughts in the reason text; the more people signal, the more accurate our understanding of consensus will be.\n\nThanks!\nthe verbs ⌐◨-◨ ",

V2\n\n# Proposal\n\n![Header](https://i.imgur.com/Aw5LE39.png)\n\n**Play as One Noun, Every Day, Forever, in an action rogue-lite game developed in collaboration with Nouns and Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult to be released on Steam/PC!**\n\n### **TL;DR**\nWe are asking for $75,000 to deliver a polished and playable vertical slice for our indie Nouns game developed in Godot 4.  We will also explore the game mechanics and creative direction with the Nouns community to discover product-market fit.\n\nPlay our pre-production demo [here](https://thepixelshop.itch.io/nounstown-demo)!\n\n# A Vertical Slice of One Noun, Every Day\n\n![stage_nouns_v_souls.png](https://i.imgur.com/hK0MOWs.png)\n\n**The One Noun, Every Day game mode will be the hook and anchor behind this game.  We want to re-imagine the continuity and diversity of Nouns through the lens of a dynamic and captivating game for the masses**.  \n\nJust as each blockchain hash determines the traits for each noun, every day, we will use a game seed to generate new elements for a each game, every day.  These changing elements include Nouns equipped with fun and diverse items, a generative world map populated with vibrant environments, random upgrades available to select from, and enemy minions and bosses you must battle to win.  Every player will have a 24 hour rolling period to defeat each version of the game.  This innovative mechanic has the potential to fuel a social and competitive gaming culture due to the following reasons:\n\n- Replayability - Optimize gameplay strategies through trial and error as you explore new characters and maps\n- Progression - Unlock new content and playable characters to use in the “Classic Mode” by defeating the game and a robust achievement system\n- Competition - Compete against all other players for the fastest clear time, and more importantly, bragging rights!\n- Game Metas - Discover unpredictable metas in a dynamic Nounish world\n\n## **Funding Details and Deliverables**\n\n**We are asking for $75,000 to develop a polished and playable vertical slice of the One Noun, Every Day game loop to demonstrate our intended player experience.** \n\nThis funding request provides for a $65,000 production budget (approximately 1,500 hours) and a $10,000 marketing budget, over an approximately 3-month period.  Key features required to produce this vertical slice include player character design, items and upgrades, environment design, sound design, UI/UX, and a single boss encounter.  Each feature will go through design and documentation, art and animation, programming and development, sound design, and testing and quality assurance, as applicable.  The deliverables and estimated allocation are as follows:\n\n- 1 Boss Encounter - 20 percent or 300 hours\n- Generative Map and Environment Assets - 20 percent or 300 hours\n- 7 Items and 7 Upgrades - 15 percent or 225 hours\n- 7 Rotating Nouns Characters - 15 percent or 225 hours\n- Sound design for completed features - 10 percent or 150 hours\n- Functional UI/UX for Menus and Gameplay - 10 percent or 150 hours\n- Comprehensive Game Design Document - 10 percent or 150 hours\n\nWe have allocated a marketing budget of $10,000 to produce the following deliverables:\n\n- Branding and Marketing Assets\n- Establish Social Media presence and Steam Page\n- Professional Teaser Trailer\n\n# Creative Direction\n\n## Nouns\n\nOur game embraces a clash of two starkly contrasting worlds. On one side, the Nounish personality will be at the core of the player character, the items and upgrades you acquire during each run, and NPCs you discover over time.  These elements will be designed to permeate Nounish personality through vibrant colors, joyful energy, and whimsical ideas. \n\n### Items\n\nWe are exploring ideas that are “outside of the box” and consistent with the outlandish and diversely strange Nouns world.  \n\n### Upgrades\n\nAs the player clears each room,  they are rewarded a pair of Noggles that unlocks a powerful new upgrade to use during the run.  Players will experiment with different combinations of upgrades to create fun synergies and provide a unique gameplay experience each run.  Each upgrade is inspired by various characters from the Nouns collection.  \n\n## Forgotten Souls\n\nAnd on the other side, you'll uncover the corrupt Forgotten Souls that have crossed into the Nouniverse upon discovering the power of Noggles.  The Souls are holding Nouns captive in their inanimate forms and using the power from the stolen Noggles to convert the Nouniverse into their own shadowy realm.  The Souls will serve as the enemy minions, bosses, and antagonist of our game, designed with contrasting dark personalities and colors.  \n\n### Minions\n\nAll minions will be designed to showcase their haunting personalities through fantastical and diverse character design, animations, and attack styles.  The contrasting nature of the minions will provide for an aesthetic design that emphasizes readability and a visual feeling of cleansing the corruption from Nouns Town as the player progresses.  \n\n![Minions](https://i.imgur.com/aZx9FC4.png)\n\n### Bosses\n\nOur boss encounters thrive to be one of the more memorable experiences that you will encounter in our game.  Our bosses will be inspired by rare Forgotten Souls characters but have our own stylistic flare.  These boss encounters will be visually stunning and paired with cohesive game play mechanics that immerse and challenge the player.  \n\n## Environment\n\nThe collision of these two distinct moods creates a captivating experience.  Each run will begin as a corrupt Nouniverse that has taken over by the Souls.  As the player progresses through the map, the corruption is pushed back and the vibrant Nounish world is slowly restored!  \n\nWe’ll design Nounish locations with their own distinct aesthetics and corresponding play styles.  Each location on the map will go through a similar design process and produce the following deliverables:\n\n- Concept Design - Establish the location’s identity with clearly defined characteristics\n- Map Assets - Represent each location by a low resolution design on the map\n- Tile Sets -  Outfit the walls, floors, and objects within the rooms of each location.  The following tile set was used in our demo and will receive a Nounish update:\n    ![Demo Tileset](https://i.imgur.com/Bc2Ms0C.png)\n- Decorations and Objects - Fill each room with decorations for personality and destructible objects for an interactive setting\n\n## Creative Commons\n\nAll of the art and animations that we produce will be open-source and available for anyone to use!\n\n# Future Vision\n\n**The goal of this proposal is to “follow the fun” through addicting game play and Nounish creative expressions.  However, we have a long term vision to produce and distribute a fully fleshed out Nouns indie game.**\n\n### Additional Classic Mode\n\nOur core game loop will be the One Noun, Every Day game mode.  However, as the player character and map remain constant in this game mode, we also plan to release a Classic Mode to serve as a more traditional rogue-lite focused on randomness and meta progression, or progression that exists outside of regular gameplay.  In this mode, no two runs will be the same as a fresh new map is generated with each play through.  \n\nBut there’s also significant depth beyond the randomness.  This mode will be accompanied with a robust achievement system that challenges the player to unlock exciting new items, upgrades, and cosmetics.  \n\n### Organic Growth\n\nDuring development, we’ll maintain a steady pipeline of project updates, promotional content, and social engagement to generate organic growth.  Additionally, we plan to attend major game development conventions such as GDC, PAX, and Gamescon to engage with our community in person.  \n\n### Game Distribution\n\nWe will use Steam as our primary distribution platform to release the game.  Steam provides access to the largest PC gaming community, as well as extensive marketing and analytics features.  We will explore porting the game to Nintendo Switch post-release to reach a wider audience.\n\n## Collaboration\n\n### Nouns Community\n\nWe are committed to an open and inclusive collaboration process throughout production.  We will regularly engage with select community members to explore creative discussions, validate game design concepts, and explore marketing opportunities.  Our goal is to create an immersive game that represents the Nounish identity and resonates with both the community and the player.  \n\n### Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult\n\nThe game will be in collaboration with our friends from the Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult.  Their team is well-respected and produce engaging and high-quality products and experiences.  This collaboration brings promotional support from both their community and team’s established network within the gaming, content creation, and entertainment industries.  This partnership presents an opportunity to elevate our game, expand its reach, and enhance the prospect for breakout success.\n\n### Nouns Esports\n\nWe will collaborate with Nouns Esports to generate excitement and promotional content with the game launch.  This partnership will explore ideas to engage the Nouns gaming community primarily through streaming, competitions, and giveaways.  \n\n# Why a Nounish indie game?\n\nA rogue-lite indie game provides a compelling opportunity for Nouns to enter the gaming sector:\n\n### Creative Expression\n\nIndie games provide for a perfect landscape to build a Nounish world complete with innovative game mechanics that are complimented with vibrant aesthetics and visual representation.  We aim to populate our world with original Nouns characters, an outlandish environment, and charming storytelling to engage players and cultivate a connection to Nouns culture.    \n\n### Strategic Advantages\n\nOur small indie team provides several advantages including streamlined communication, transparency, adaptability, and a strong team synergy.  Yet, while being a small team, we have access to powerful platforms such as Godot for development, Steam for distribution, and social media and Discord for our community.  Our game is thoughtfully designed to pack a punch with addictive gameplay mechanics, engaging progression and replayability, and long-term scalability and new content.  We’re able to accomplish all of this within a reasonable scope and production budget, and without sacrificing on the game’s entertainment or aesthetics.\n\n## Genre\n\nOur genre of choice may be a mouthful (Non Linear Action Rogue-Lite Bullet Hell…) but it’s a great platform for a Nouns game.  The generative rogue features share a strong parallel with the Nounish identity; bullet hells offer replayability.  We have described the key features of each sub-genres and the games that inspire us below:\n\n### Rogue-Lite\n\nThe key feature of a Rogue-Lite genre is a game loop that results in permadeath.  Each time a player begins their attempt or run, they will either defeat the final boss or die trying.  A Rogue-Lite game generally involves some meta progression that takes place outside of the run; usually in the form of upgraded items, statistics, abilities, or skill trees.\n\n### Bullet Hell\n\nBullet Hell combat mechanics emphasize complex bullet patterns for the player to navigate and dodge.  Our bullet hell game will be designed as a twin stick shooter where the player is on a flat plane with a top-down perspective.  \n\n### Non-Linear Progression\n\nOne of the unique selling points of our Rogue-Lite game is that it will have Non-Linear progression.  The two main features to highlight in this design include a unique map that is generated each run and the freedom for the player to decide their order of progression.   \n\n### Inspiration\n[Enter the Gungeon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/311690/Enter_the_Gungeon/), [Hades](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/), [Risk of Rain 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/632360/Risk_of_Rain_2/), [Nuclear Throne](https://store.steampowered.com/app/242680/Nuclear_Throne/), [Vampire Survivors](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/)\n\n# Why The Pixel Shop?\n\n![The Pixel Shop](https://i.imgur.com/57yu7tx.png)\n\n[The Pixel Shop](https://thepixelshop.app) is an independent Art and Game Development studio founded in March 2022. We are a team of four talented artists and developers with over 30 years of art and game development experience, collectively.  Our team has experience producing artwork with major indie game studios; developing game engines, commercial software, and game mods; and managing large scope projects through completion. \n\nAs a team, we recently led the creative and art direction for Battle for Goblin Town, an upcoming on-chain “Settlers of Catan” style game developed by [Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult](https://www.forgottenrunes.com/).  During this project, we designed and produced all of the art assets, UI/UX, [gameplay trailer](https://x.com/GoblinTown_Game/status/1708859222623232363?s=20). \n\n![Goblin Town Promo](https://i.imgur.com/hGejLix.png)\n\nWe also just completed our latest Moonbirds project which demonstrates our creative and technical capabilities, and shares many parallels with this Nouns proposal.  For this project, we animated all 10,000 Moonbirds as pixel sprites and introduced a mini-game as a proof-of-work to showcase how these sprites can be used in indie-game development.  All of the artwork produced for this project is cc0 for others to enjoy and build on.  Check out our [Mini-Game](https://thepixelshop.itch.io/moonbirds) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/the-pixelshop/moonbirds).\n\n![Moonbirds](https://i.imgur.com/itg7Pfh.png)\n\nWe are driven by our passion and commitment to releasing exciting pixel art games. \n Thank you for the opportunity and please provide us with any feedback that you have!

The community makes art for 24 hours. After which, the canvas locks, and an open edition NFT of the artwork is available to mint for 24 hours. \n\nI propose committing 6 ETH to mint three days of Nouns themed canvases. **For three days, the BasePaint theme would be whatever Noun is on auction at the time of which the BasePaint canvas opens**. This is a fun initiative would accomplish a few things:\n- Further cement Nouns into BasePaint works (noggles have shown up in a few works already: [BP1](https://opensea.io/assets/base/0xba5e05cb26b78eda3a2f8e3b3814726305dcac83/1), [BP33](https://opensea.io/assets/base/0xba5e05cb26b78eda3a2f8e3b3814726305dcac83/33), [BP47](https://opensea.io/assets/base/0xba5e05cb26b78eda3a2f8e3b3814726305dcac83/47) and [BP71](https://opensea.io/assets/base/0xba5e05cb26b78eda3a2f8e3b3814726305dcac83/71)).\n- Ten Nouns artists will be whitelisted for bronze BasePaint brushes to collaborate with the BasePaint community. If you're interested, [apply]([link](https://tally.so/r/3NlAMB)) and mention Nouns.\n- Support BasePaint crypto native artists \n- Make our first transaction on an L2!\n\nI've been in contact with the cofounders of BasePaint ([Zach](zherring) and [WINTΞR](https://twitter.com/w1nt3r_eth)) to set the themes for the days on which Nouns would be minting. \n\n## Logistics:\n- We’d be using the [BasePaint bot](https://www.basepaintbot.com/) to commit the ETH. \n- The proposal would be calling [Base Portal contract on Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/address/0x49048044D57e1C92A77f79988d21Fa8fAF74E97e#readProxyContract) which would both deposit and call the [BasePaint bot contract](https://basescan.org/address/0xb129419F9B035E9d80B4a320ffcf5BE93Cb7994B#code). \n- We'd be minting 699 each day (at a cost of 0.00286 per mint) for a total of 1.9999 ETH per day (699 * 0.00286).\n- The mints would be under the [DAO's alias address](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/specs/deposits.md#address-aliasing) so that the DAO can call it from L1 if it chooses to move them.\n\n\n## Timeline:\n\n- Assuming the proposal passes, the mint would start 9 days after the proposal is put onchain (7 days vote turnaround + 2 days queued). \n\n## Where the ETH would go:\nThere’s a 10% fee that the BasePaint bot takes at mint. Once minted, 90% of the profits of the OE are distributed to the artists proportional to the number of pixels they painted. 10% goes to the protocol.\n\n--- \n\n*A big thank you to [solimander](https://x.com/_solimander_), [backseats](https://x.com/backseats_eth) and [wilson](https://x.com/wilsoncusack) who helped put the tx together*",

          "description": "# Nouns House #1 - Tokyo, Jpn\n\n## **v3 updated on 11/05/2023**\n\nThis proposal serves as an alternative to Proposal Candidate **[\"Nouns House DAO\"](https://nouns.wtf/candidates/0x1bde33dbc5c2ac7109c4a7ecf0d0a0a6cd6f57cc--nouns-house-dao)**, offering a **phased approach to establishing a new Nounish subDAO called Nouns House DAO**. It outlines the first steps which includes creating the first Nouns House and mobile app. As a second step, we plan to submit follow-up proposal by Feburary 2024 to transfer initial funding to the DAO treasury followed by successful execution of this proposal.\n\n**We have already established the Nouns House DAO multi-sig [treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0BC7181dc3863932F9b375bC348fe4A421B8003A), and all of the funding from this and future proposal will be going to the treasury.**\n\n***\n\n## TL;DR\n\nHello! I am **[tenichiliu.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/tenichiliu.eth)**, co-founder of Enabler DAO (**[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/enabler.fun/)**, **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/enablerofficial)**, **[Website](https://enablerdao.com/)**). Our decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) focuses on gathering, utilizing, managing, and improving idle assets like unused houses and cars within communities worldwide. My fellow co-founder at Enabler DAO, **[yukihamada.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/yukihamada.eth)**, is a holder of **[Noun 312](https://nouns.wtf/noun/312)**, and we believe in the power and potential of NounsDAO just as you do.\n\nWe are proposing a funding of **47,600 USDC** to give a Nounish makeover to a vacation rental property in Tokyo, Japan, valued over $1,000,000 USD. We intend to create “Nouns House #1” with this funding. Our property has already completed interior and exterior renovations; **all of the funding will be used for the Nounish makeover, and development of the mobile app.**\n\nBeyond just providing the property for Nouns House #1, **we will contribute 10% of the profits made from Nouns House #1 to the Nouns House DAO treasury for the first 5 years**. For future Nouns Houses real estates that are funded by the treasury, 100% of the profits will be returned to the treasury.\n\nIn alignment with NounsDAO’s CC0 philosophy, we will make all software and hardware implemented in this project open source. Furthermore, we plan to collaborate with the Nouns projects that are active in Japan such as **[pNouns](https://pnouns.wtf/en/)** (**[Noun 553](https://nouns.wtf/noun/553)**, **[Noun 556](https://nouns.wtf/noun/556)**) for events and promotions.\n\n**The diverse industry experience of our team will significantly contribute to the success of this project.** **[yukihamada.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/yukihamada.eth)** is a former executive CPO at Mercari, **[yukill.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/yukill.eth)** is a former CEO at ZOZO Technologies, **[Jiro](https://twitter.com/jiroisagame)** is a former YouTuber with 1.3 million subscribers, and I, **[tenichiliu.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/tenichiliu.eth)**, am a former engineer from Amazon Seattle.\n\nThis proposal was inspired by **[Nouns Deli](https://twitter.com/NounsDeli)**’s proposal (**[Proposal 254](https://nouns.wtf/vote/254)**, approved on 03/09/2023). Our next step is to establish a Nounish subDAO, called “Nouns House DAO”. Similar to the **[Nouns Builder Protocol](https://nouns.build/)** (**[Proposal 167](https://nouns.wtf/vote/167)**, approved on 11/12/2022), we aim to create a subDAO inheriting NounsDAO’s auction, treasury, and governance system. In the follow-up proposal, we plan to request initial funding for Nouns House DAO treasury, in order to create Nouns House #2 and subsequent Nouns Houses based on community decisions governed by the DAO.\n\n## 1.  Nouns House DAO ⌐◧-◧\n\nNouns House #1 created through this proposal will serve as the first Nouns House governed by Nouns House DAO. Following the successful execution of this proposal, we will submit a follow-up proposal to transfer initial funding to the Nouns House DAO treasury. This initial funding will be substantial enough to secure the purchase of the second Nouns House. The exact amount, along with detailed plans and specific property information, will be disclosed in this follow-up proposal. We believe that having initial funding in the treasury will create strong momentum for this new Nounish DAO.\n\nOur goal is to establish Nouns Houses in major cities globally, allowing individuals to experience Nouns art and culture. Additionally, we aim to **operate this as a profitable venture**, positioning Nouns House DAO as the pioneering Nounish subDAO that introduces a **3rd revenue pillar for the treasury, complementing the NFT auctioning and ETH staking.**\n\nNouns House DAO will oversee the operation and financial management of all Nouns Houses. **As a testament to our commitment, we will contribute 10% of the profits from Nouns House #1 to treasury for the first 5 years.** For all subsequent real estates that are funded by the Nouns House DAO treasury, 100% of the profits will be directed back to the treasury.\n\n![Bedroom](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1W23f_T6aANo9mXh9-lUu3bypKSzU12M4)\n\n## 2. Enabler DAO / Core Team ⌐◧-◧\n\nEnabler DAO is a asset sharing community that aims to facilitate easy sharing of large assets like houses and cars by leveraging blockchain and AI technology. As of November 2023, we operate 10 properties across 5 locations (Tokyo, Kyoto, Atami, Teshikaga, and Honolulu) in Japan and the United States. These properties are monetized through asset sharing within the community as well as through Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) such as Airbnb and Booking.com. Below are some of our properties and links to OTAs.\n\n🇯🇵 [**WHITE HOUSE Atami**](https://airbnb.com/h/white-house-atami\n) - Shizuoka, Japan\n🇯🇵 [**MACHIYA Kyoto**](https://www.kyoto-machiya-inn.com/accommodations/hanatoki/\n) - Kyoto, Japan\n🇯🇵 [**THE NEST Teshikaga**](https://airbnb.com/h/the-nest-teshikaga) - Hokkaido, Japan\n🇺🇸 [**BEACH HOUSE Honolulu**](https://airbnb.com/h/beach-house-honolulu-annex) - Hawaii, USA\n\n![Properties](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1C5UfxmK62s98QryMGZ_SoTIpED1fTUru)\n\nThe 4 founders of Enabler DAO are **[yukihamada.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/yukihamada.eth)** (**[Noun 312](https://nouns.wtf/noun/312)**), former executive CPO of Mercari; **[yukill.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/yukill.eth)**, former CEO at ZOZO Technologies & fund manager for MZ Web3 Fund; **[Jiro](https://twitter.com/jiroisagame)**, former YouTuber “Charisma Brothers” with 1.3 million subscribers & managing partner at iFund; and **[tenichiliu.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/tenichiliu.eth)**, a trilingual former Amazon HQ engineer with 5-years of experience. \n\nEnabler DAO was founded in October 2021, and we currently operate with about 10 DAO members. We have been operating highly successful and profitable vacation rental properties in multiple locations (10~20% annual ROI), and bring expertise in both rental operations and property management. Moreover, our diverse team brings a wide range of business and product development experience, combined with our strong track record, **I believe we are in a unique position to be successful at running the first Nouns House.**\n\n## **3. Nounish Makeover ⌐◧-◧**\n\nWe plan to transform our property in Aoyama, an upscale district in Tokyo, into \"Nouns House #1,\" with a Nounish makeover filled with art and goodies. \n\n![Living Room](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1bwo_xZOKns30glLVRyeoQ7ROKojrQkIE)\n\nAoyama is a hub of designer boutiques, art galleries, cafes, and shopping districts. It's not only a attracts for affluent individuals but also a popular tourist destination. Given the area's reputation and successful track record of our nearby properties, **we anticipate strong demand for high-end vacation rental property in Aoyama.**\n\n![Sauna](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1kabDge7tB6HDlZqn1fYccFdnsMt0-AdX)\n\nIn recent years, there has been a “sauna boom” in Japan. The number of sauna enthusiasts has been increasing due to heightened health consciousness and the proliferation of sauna facilities. In fact, the number of sauna users in Japan has increased by more than one million in the past year, and high-end sauna facilities in Tokyo are extremely popular. **We believe that Nouns House #1 will become widely popular within the sauna communities and beyond.**\n\n![Bath](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=190MOtkZF68sFwLUJzwbxoO4hNEtKDfch)\n\nThe artwork used for interior and exterior of Nouns House #1 will be directed by [amiyoko.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/amiyoko.eth) who have contributed many artwork to various Nouns projects such as NounsDAO Anniversary Art 2023 and Sushi Nouns.\n\n![Exterior](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1bESaiRK3zLewixG-8MvEEq9HgIhnkbqc)\n\nThe 1st floor is the sauna area, the 2nd floor features a living-dining-kitchen area, and the 3rd floor will be an office space and a bedroom. We aim to infuse each floor with Nounish elements while maintaining a sense of luxury in the interior design.\n\n![Chill](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1CvxZml-3RPmPaHxNUzN7yUE2DKu-wLyU)\n\n## 4. Marketing Efforts **⌐◧-◧**\n\nTo amplify the presence of Nouns House #1, **we will be forming a strategic partnership with a popular Japanese YouTuber group, [EvisJap](https://youtube.com/@EvisJap?si=6Oi6Ll6fIzis70ib).** With a subscriber base of 630,000, primarily young adults, they are known for their energetic travel blogs and lively social gatherings that resonate with the adventurous spirit of youth.\n\nDuring the weekdays, EvisJap will be utilizing Nouns House #1 as their recording studio, bringing a creative buzz to the space while providing regular exposure of Nouns to a broad audience through their videos. On weekends, Nouns House #1 will transform into an luxury private sauna. This dual-use approach optimizes the utility of the property, and exemplifies the innovative and adaptive spirit of the Nouns.\n\nThis collaboration, born from our unique relationship with EbisJap, is a synergy that offers exposure to Nouns House without direct marketing efforts. The value of this organic promotion is an example of the unique contribution that our team brings to the Nouns community.\n\n## **5. Mobile App ⌐◧-◧**\n\n**We will develop a mobile app for facilitating reservations and assigning maintenance work for Nouns House DAO**. This app will be powered by open-source framework called **[Skeet](https://skeet.dev/en/)** which seamlessly integrates with Google Cloud Platform and Firebase, making it easier to develop serverless full-stack applications. \n\nIt's worth noting that both Enabler and **[El Soul Labo](https://labo.elsoul.nl/en/)**, the team behind Skeet, received equity funding from **[East Ventures](https://east.vc/)**, one of the biggest venture capital fund in Asia. With the cutting edge Skeet framework and the invaluable support from the creator of Skeet, we can efficiently develop this app with just one engineer on our end.\n\nThe app will integrate with existing tools that offers API such as **[Beds24](https://beds24.com/)** for inventory management, **[Sesame Smart Lock](https://jp.candyhouse.co/)** for automatically issuing one-time guest keys, and **[Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-jp)** for fiat payment processing. In the interim, before our app release, we'll use **[LINE](https://line.me/en/)** and **[LINE Marketplace](https://line-marketplace.com/jp/app)** apps for chat-based reservation.\n\nFurthermore, we will incorporate web3 capabilities such as token-gating and cryptocurrency payment into the app. We plan to offer special coupons and priority reservations to Nouns House NFT holders, and allow payments in major cryptocurrencies.\n\n## **6. Utility Token ⌐◧-◧**\n\nWe plan to introduce a utility token which will be used for accessing Nouns House and can be earned through completing maintenance gigs listed in the app. **We envision some members of the Nouns House DAO to work maintenance gigs in order to earn the utility token.** We plan to use Solana chain for the token for 3 reasons: near-zero gas fees, rapid execution, and its integration with the user-friendly multi-chain wallet called Phantom. Enabler DAO has already been experimenting with Solana based utility token called [**EBR**](https://solscan.io/token/E1JxwaWRd8nw8vDdWMdqwdbXGBshqDcnTcinHzNMqg2Y) (available on [**Orca DEX**](https://v1.orca.so/liquidity/browse?tokenMint=E1JxwaWRd8nw8vDdWMdqwdbXGBshqDcnTcinHzNMqg2Y)) and have experience in this realm.\n\n## **7. Roadmap ⌐◧-◧**\n\nWe will begin the Nounish makeover and the development of mobile app, immediately following the approval of this proposal. In January 2024, we plan to pre-open Nouns House #1, followed by grand opening in February. Beta version of mobile app will be released in March, followed by production release in April. We will submit submit a follow-up proposal by Feburary 2024 to transfer initial funding for the DAO treasury followed by successful execution of this proposal.\n\n![Roadmap](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1xkl6xzFYEi-rAtpjmnARWpc34Pj_Dlh4)\n\n## **8. Budget ⌐◧-◧**\n\nWe are proposing **47,600 USDC funding for creating Nouns House #1 and to kick start the software infrastructure development for Nouns House DAO.** The Nounish makeover will cost $17,000, and the development of the mobile app will cost $30,600. All work will commence immediately upon the approval of the proposal.\n\n**Nouns House #1 Nounish Makeover: $17,000**\n- \"Nounish\" Exterior Wall Art: $6,000\n- \"Nounish\" Interior Art: $8,000\n- \"Nounish\" Goodies: $3,000\n\n**Mobile App (6-month development): $30,600**\n- Founding Engineer: $5,000/month\n- [Skeet](https://skeet.dev/en/) (Enterprise Support): $100/month\n\n## **9. Community Benefits ⌐◧-◧**\n\nThis proposal aims to **expand the Nouns community by creating the first \"Nouns House\", a network of properties where people can experience Nouns art and culture in major cities worldwide.**\n\nIn the next step, we will propose to transfer initial funding for Nouns House DAO treasury. This new Nounish subDAO will own Real World Asset (RWA) and operate them as a profit-making business. RWA is an area where the web3 industry is still struggling, and this new venture has the potential to significantly advance the industry on this front.\n\nNouns House NFT holders will be offered special perks such as discounted rates and priority access to Nouns Houses via token gating. Additionally, upon the funding of the Nouns House DAO treasury in our next proposal, **existing Nouns NFT holders can apply for Nouns House NFT airdrop by a pre-determined date**. This airdrop is optional and provides an opportunity for existing NounsDAO members to participate in the governance for Nouns House DAO without having to bid in the auction.\n\n## **10. CC0 ⌐◧-◧**\n\nWe believe, Nouns House’s CC0 culture will bring innovation to the real estate industry. While real estate design and architecture are generally not open-source, we will make all of these publicly available through our CC0 library. CC0 approach will also have a large impact on the vacation rental industry. **By providing tools to help achieve efficient operations, we will accelerate the automation and digital transformation of the vacation rental industry.** The interest and attention that this CC0 model will generate within these industries will serve as the ideal platform for spreading the culture and values of Nouns.\n\n## **11. Risks & Considerations ⌐◧-◧**\n\nWe are enthusiastic members of the Nouns community and, as Noun owner, strongly resonate with the vision of Nouns. **We believe that the Nouns model holds innovative power in asset management and vacation rental fields.** This decentralized, community-led governance model has the potential to offer new approaches in asset sharing and feels like the ideal way to manage assets in a decentralized manner. On the other hand, there are some risks considered in achieving the vision of this project:\n\n1. **Regulatory Risk**: Operating within a decentralized framework could potentially make the project subject to regulations. Compliance with local laws is crucial.\n2. **Technical Risk**: The integration of blockchain technology with physical assets like real estate presents several challenges. The implementation of smart contracts to manage the property must be executed flawlessly.\n3. **Community Engagement**: The strength of a DAO lies in its community. For long-term success, it's important to maintain community engagement and participation in governance.\n\nBy acknowledging these risks and proactively addressing them, we aim for the success of the Nouns House project.",

Emergent behavior such as the formation of [Keep Nouns Weird (KNW)](https://twitter.com/keepnounsweird)  ensured the health of the community was preserved, as a rush to take advantage of the treasury threatened the future of Nouns.\n\n# The Future of Governance Pools\n\nGovernance pools auction off votes for each proposal, allowing anyone to bid on how they should be cast. Although this can lead to unwanted behavior, there's a plethora of real world use that shows governance pools can be used to advance our ecosystem in a positive way by extending the Nouns game with a fun and social experience.\n\n![social](https://i.postimg.cc/cLMzdNQm/praise.png)\n\nA specific list of features is tentative, but directionally the next version of governance pools will provide a more consumer based experience and support:\n\n- Social features such as \"bid with reason\"\n- Crowdfunding of bids\n- Safety measures like a threshold vote to veto malicious bids\n- Indicators for real time activity on the site (e.g. cursors on party.app)\n- Experimentation around pricing of votes (e.g. a time based pricing curve for auction reserve price to incentivize early bids vs last minute swings)\n- 100% of auction proceeds sent to the DAO treasury\n\nUltimately the community will be able to provide input on how parts of the protocol are developed, ensuring that governance pools are used for good and remain a positive force for Nouns. \n\nParticipating in governance pools needs to be **FUN**!\n\n# Other\n\nTo ensure that the community has full control over Nouns delegated to the pool an intermediate contract will be created that custodies them and manages the pool delegation. The community will be the owner of the contract, providing the ability to withdraw Nouns in the future at any time using the standard proposal process.\n\nUntil then, I'm asking for the Nouns to be sent to a multisig with signers [xxx]. The Nouns will sit idle until governance pools v2 is released.\n\n# Budget & Terms\n\n400 ETH and 20 Nouns\n\nThe funds will be allocated towards: \n\n- infrastructure and server costs\n- funding the team and outside help\n- continued iterations and support post deployment\n- audits\n- grants to support new and existing initiatives like Keep Nouns Weird\n\nThe Nouns will be stored in a multisig located at: 0x000\n\nAll code can be found on our [GitHub](https://github.com/nounish/)\n\n\\- [wiz](https://twitter.com/0xWiz_)",

          "description": "# The Noun Pulse: Meme Analysis Database and Analytics - Updated\n\n\nEDIT: We've updated this proposal based on community feedback. Looking forward to your thoughts!\n\n---\n\n*“Is Nouns activity growing?” “Who is helping increase engagement and spreading the meme?” “Which proposals are driving growth?” “What’s our spend rate?” “How many builders are contributing to the Nouns ecosystem?” “Are the amount of proposal candidates increasing?”*\n\n## **TL;DR**\n\nWe aim to create a single-purpose website where Nouns activity metrics are published. It will integrate activity across social channels and highlight which Nouns, advocates, and proposals have best supported the Noun’s meme propagation. Our creative motto is: *Track Memes, Not People.*\n\nAs a starting point, this proposal focuses on [1] onchain activity (supported by the Nouns subgraph), [2] two sources of social media (Farcaster and Instagram), and [3] a limited set of metrics — such as proposal submissions, votes, comments, posts, and engagement. Opportunistically, we will incorporate additional sources and expand the set of metrics.\n\n## Background\n\nAs of the moment, the Nouns’ community and audience members produce a wide variety of data. Over time, more data is likely to migrate onchain (e.g. similar to vote comments today) and data will be produced across even more digital localities. The *United World of Nouns* will have a wide-ranging data footprint. Combining data across these localities can become a powerful tool for proposal development and decision-making.\n\nHowever, as @Krel mentioned in their [Request for Proposers](https://www.notion.so/Nouns-DAO-Request-for-Proposers-94dadff999ac493b9902aa002e4b296e?pvs=21):\n\n> *“Nouns DAO does not have a reliable way to measure ‘growth’ or ‘success’. Its not clear what should be measured, or what growth in the context of Nouns even means.”*\n> \n\nThis project will create an initial repository of activity growth combining onchain and offchain data. We are long overdue to experiment on this front!\n\n## Scope\n\nThe metrics tracker will be in the form of a single-purpose web application.\n\nTo begin, we will include onchain data available in the Nouns Subgraph and two social media channels: Farcaster and Instagram. We will publish a selection of core metrics that provide clarity to Noun holders and the wider community.\n\nMost importantly, the underlying data pool (Meme Activity Database) will serve a first step towards a data-driven Nouns culture, which community members and potential builders can use to find opportunities for proposal submissions.\n\nSuccess of this project will be measured based on web application usage (unique visitors), proposal references (e.g. This project will increase X metric supporting Noun activity growth), and data pool connections (e.g. external usage of the Meme Activity Database).\n\nAs a stretch goal, we will look to expand the data sources, for example including key derivative NFT projects (Gnars, LilNouns, cc0-lib) and other dominant social spaces (Discord, Discourse, X, Lens, etc).\n\n*Note: X (formerly Twitter) has been deprioritized due to its cost ($5k per month) until initiative is proven useful. It would be included in future proposals.*\n\n*Note: Discord has been deprioritized due to its fragmentation (there multiple Nouns servers) until initiative is proven useful. It would be included in future proposals.*\n\n## Product Components\n\n### \n\nWhenever we want to test our internet speed, we can easily go to a speed test website. If we want to see how our activity on X (formerly Twitter), we can go to profile analytics. \n\n**Where do we go to check how the Nouns ecosystem is growing?** We go to *.*\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByD5JEHfp.png)\n\nThe Pulse is a single purpose website showcasing onchain and offchain activity metrics. This includes public conversations related to the **********************United World of Nouns.********************** The main graph, which we are currently calling *“Activity Momentum”* will showcase daily activity growth, a proxy for the Noun meme adoption and mind-share online.\n\nOur data analytics approach will combine methodologies from (1) traditional media broadcasting (e.g. combining data like number of views, replies, likes, proposal submissions, unique voters, etc.), (2) crypto-native metrics common across DAOs, and (3) materials science and engineering (read more about how engineers develop [material selection indexes here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_selection)).\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJSJgVrGp.png)\n\nData will be synchronized in real-time directly from the Nouns’ Subgraph, Farcaster, Instagram to an SQL database. The sync mechanism will be architected in a uniform adapter interface for easier future integration with other onchain data and offchain sources, such as Twitter, Discourse, Discord, Telegram, DeSo, and Lens.\n\n**Example Onchain Metrics:**\n\n- Treasury\n- Treasury Usage Rate (Monthly Spend)\n- Burn Value\n- Candidate Props Growth\n- Proposal Submissions Growth\n- Active Proposals\n- Percent of Proposals Funded\n- Total Unique Builders\n- Average Auction Price\n\n**Example Offchain Metrics:**\n\n- Number of Posts\n- Total Engagement (Likes+Comments+Shares)\n- Engagement Rate (Ratio of Engagement to Posts)\n- Most Engaged Content\n- Total Followers\n- Follower Growth Rate (Updated based on API opportunity)\n- Noggles Score: Count of posts using “⌐◨-◨” on Farcaster*\n\n**In the first phase it won’t be possible to index Instagram posts by content, only be hashtags. As a result, the Noggles Score won’t be able to include Instagram posts.*\n\n### Meme Activity Database (a.k.a. The MAD)\n\nCurcially, the product’s underlying data model will be available for others to query and contribute to. That way, others can embed the index into their own Noun interfaces. Anyone should be able to get clean and reliable **meme-data-as-a-service** to support a diversity of Noun initiatives. Imagine a world where active proposals have conversation hype trackers, or ongoing projects can easily see total impressions across social media channels.\n\nAt the end of the day, we want to facilitate the use of data across the Nouns ecosystem. As the cc0 library enables media usage, the activity database enables tracking and impact analysis.\n\nThe Web API interface will be available publicly in the form of parametrizable JSON endpoints. The data will be distributed per specific sources (onchain Nouns, Farcaster, and others) as well as in aggregated form to enable the development of tools such as alerts, bots, and analytics dashboards.\n\n## Product Roadmap\n\nThe execution of this project will be done in an iterative fashion. By building in public and getting ongoing feedback, we can deliver what the community needs, and data that will support Nouns decisions.\n\n**Iterative Phases:**\n\n- **Phase 1:** Deliver basic UI w/ limited branding and processed Farcaster data displayed in form of metrics. Deliver mock-up UI for onchain metrics and Instagram metrics. Host open Q&A with Nouns (e.g. via Aburra) to gather community feedback.\n- **Phase 2:** Deliver basic UI w/ Farcaster metric feedback, plus Noun Subgraph indexing and onchain metrics. Host open Q&A (e.g. via Aburra) to gather community feedback.\n- **Phase 3:** Deliver basic UI w/ Farcaster, Onchain metric feedback, and Instagram metrics for specific accounts and hashtags. Host open Q&A (e.g. via Aburra) to gather community feedback.\n- **Phase 4:** Complete UI polishing and metrics calibration. Host open Q&A (e.g. via Aburra) to celebrate launch and discuss future opportunities (where next).\n\n## An Ambitious Vision\n\nThis project aims to uncover what “Nouns-Native” analytics could look like, and what data infrastructure is necessary to feed this analytics into the broader Nouns governance and participation process.\n\nWe’ve already intuited that we want to ***Track*** ***Memes, Not People*** — and we’re certain there will be other innovations along the way. After all, we need to address challenges in crossing the web3-to-web2 data pipeline chasm. Is it possible? We think so.\n\nNouns is a place for ambitious ideas, and we are an ambitious team.\n\n## Team\n\nThis project will be led and executed by Rafa Fernandez (Farcaster: @rafa) and Rafi Gutkowski (Farcaster: @rafi). \n\n- Rafa Fernandez is a community architect with a focus on building [Digital Public Utilities](https://www.notion.so/General-Networks-e4615b9b52294f8bab34a82b47023d11?pvs=21). He has decade of experience in corporate analytics and studied materials-science and engineering. He is the founder of Folklore (Folklore.Institute), a community that curates and commissions research on digital cultures. Most recently, he was part of the Summer of Protocols research program looking at [online swarms](https://www.notion.so/Welcome-to-the-Swarm-41c114211ac045f087c44c16bd993748?pvs=21). Previous to the program he worked at Mirror where he worked in creator partnerships and community development.\n- Rafi Gutkowski is a software engineer and data scientist ([libred.org](https://libred.org/), [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/rgutkowski)). He started mining bitcoin in 2015 but only after exiting from his recent startup, did he double down on web3. Since then Rafi has been working on sementic analysis of decentralized social graphs, as well as creating web3-web2 bridges, such as Folklore’s web3-signature to feed [broadcast applet](https://www.notion.so/Folklore-5d34757913064064b87119c4593eda74?pvs=21).\n\n## Funding\n\nWe are a stream of 22.5 ETH to fund this project over approximately 10 weeks.\n\nThe funds will be allocated to a two-person team (Rafa and Rafi). They are split roughly 25-75 between planning and iterative engineering. There is about a 40-40-10 between data engineering, visuals and handoff. There is approximately 10% reserved for bugs and issue resolution.\n\nWe expect that once the initial traunch of data engineering and visuals is complete, then we can make a decision on what the community needs more of (if anything), such as expanded data, or expanded analysis\n\n## Our Commitments\n\n- We commit to posting updates on [updates.wtf](https://updates.wtf/) with sprint plan and outcomes, in alignment with each of the community Q&A feedback sessions.\n- We commit to cancelling the stream based on community feedback.\n- We commit to executing this work as an open-source project, such that other onchain communities and organizations can benefit.\n\n## Other Notes\n\nThis proposal was built based on the Basic Nouns Proposal Template, built by Rafa and available here: https://hackmd.io/@rafathebuilder/BkPAmHZbp\n\nIf you’d like to learn more about this proposal, the first Q&A conversation on Aburra is available here: https://youtu.be/_dr2yZulMG",

We want to bring accessibility and utility of Nouns to **everyone** by providing a simple, seamless way to use Nouns avatars and art across the best digital platforms and spaces. \n\n![nounsIntegrations](https://baunsu.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/nouns/pineappleMosaic.gif)\n\n## Proposal brief\nWith the Bounce platform, we want to bridge the Nouniverse and the open Metaverse:\n\n- make current and future Nouns easily to use, seamlessly, across digital platforms ⇒ **everyone** can experience and enjoy Nouns, forever\n- bring exposure in more spaces to new audiences, both web3 and web2 ⇒ **grow** Nouns community\n- build and open and extensible system with a Bounce API & SDK ⇒ **empower** community to innovate and build on top of Bounce\n\n## Feedback Q&A\n\n**onizuka.eth - Abstained**\n\n**Q**: I think there is a value in proliferating across Snap/Instagram, but I think there has already been progress made on filters there (from CoralOrca?) I'm not sure what exactly the public API would be for? general infrastructure like this can be valuable, but I'm not optimistic about something like the bounce site getting any sort of use from such a decentralized org like Nouns\n\n**A**: Great feedback and thanks for bringing up these points. CoralOrca and 0xFloyd have done fantastic work on [social filters](https://www.snapchat.com/explore/nouns/lenses), as well as [Noun 3D models](https://3dnouns.xyz/). This proposal builds on top of both of these by providing a hub where all experiences are easily accessible, not only social filters but also VR Chat, Mona, and any other platforms that will be integrated into Bounce in the future.\n\nOur goal is to make these cross-platform experiences easily accessible through all DAO projects, both web (with a public API to link directly to Nouns experiences) and physical (Bounce NFC tags, QR codes). The Bounce site will act as a hub for Nouns and other onboarded projects, and will help bring in other users and communities into the Nouniverse.\n\n## Budget\n\nWe’re asking for 15 ETH (to the Bounce multisig safe) to onboard Nouns onto Bounce and enable cross-world experiences.\nThe budget includes:\n\n- Build a Nouns X Bounce community microsite\n- Cost of asset onboarding and processing all existing and future Nouns for the following platforms:\n    - VRChat\n    - Mona\n    - Snap\n    - Instagram\n- Making Bounce connections free for everyone, across all spaces, forever\n- Developing new platform integrations for spaces the Nouns community is excited about\n\n# Proposal\n\nBounce is a new cross-world digital asset platform that makes it easy for fans and collectors to embody their avatars in immersive web2 and web3 platforms, and connect with their communities. Our goal is to empower avatar communities to embody their avatars, express themselves and come together in more immersive and engaging ways.\n\nThis proposal is to onboard Nouns onto Bounce as an early partner, making Nouns enjoyable by the community across a range of digital spaces, including social, gaming and metaverse platforms\n\n## How Bounce benefits the Nouns community\n\n- Easily enjoy Nouns as avatars, sticker packs, face filters and more across social, gaming and metaverse platforms\n- Expand the community and reach of the Nouns brand and content across digital spaces\n- Access more platforms and experiences as they roll out, new spaces are available to all Nouns, new and existing\n- Support other DAO projects with public API and SDK that make “bouncing” a seamless and hassle-free process\n- Bounce Tags support phygital projects with easy onboarding and allocated stock\n- Nouns on Bounce will be free for everyone, forever\n\n## Deliverables\n\nThe project is estimated at 1.5 to 2 months and will include:\n\n- **A unique Bounce X Nouns microsite** where the community can go to bounce across spaces and enjoy exclusive content. This site also acts as a landing page for special Nouns events and activations across spaces. (EXAMPLE MOCKUP BELOW)\n    \n    ![nounsMicrositeMockup.jpg](https://baunsu.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/nouns/nounsPage.jpg)\n    \n- **Cross platform digital avatars** that can be used as in-space characters, face lenses and filters, sticker packs and more across a range of platforms.\n    \n    Platforms include:\n    \n  - VR Chat\n    \n    ![VRChat Nouns](https://baunsu.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/nouns/vrchatGifNouns.gif)\n\n    \n  - Mona\n    \n    ![Mona Nouns](https://baunsu.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/nouns/monaGif.gif)\n  \n    \n  - AR Filters: (ROUGH PROTOTYPE BELOW)\n    - Snap\n    - Instagram\n    \n    ![AR Filter Nouns](https://baunsu.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/nouns/social+lenses.gif)\n\n    \n- More spaces the community is excited about\n- **Public API, SDK and docs** that can be used by other DAO projects to give utility to digital assets and make bouncing a hassle free integration.\n- **Free access to everyone, across all spaces, forever**\n\nWe also commit to posting frequent updates on https://www.updates.wtf/ to keep the community informed on progress and updates, both as the proposal is developed, and as future platforms and experiences are rolled out and made available.\n\n# Future proposals\n\n## Bounce X Nouniverse events and community activations\n\nWe think the best way to experience bounce as a community is through special events, gatherings and activations. Our collab with the Wassies community was made so much more exciting by their VR Chat Among Us and Zombie Survival (https://twitter.com/ByWassiesEvents)\n\nAs Nouns is decentralized, we’d like to put forward future proposals to design, plan, coordinate and market events and games across platforms.\n\n## Bounce Tags for DAO and community projects\n\nBounce Tags, our secure chain-linked NFC tags, are integrated into the Bounce ecosystem and make bouncing from a physical collectible to digital spaces a quick and seamless experience. Many DAO proposals are dedicated to crafting both amazing new Nouns physical products (Noggle Changers, NounsDAO x Pudgy Penguins toys, NOUNISH FRIENDS mini-figures, etc), and these could all be linked using tags (think tapping your Nouns glasses and bouncing to Nouns AR filters and more). We would like to put forward a future proposal to provide tags for community projects (as part of their proposals) that will be custom designed, programmed and integrated with our support. \n\n# Who we are\n\n## About Bounce\n\nBounce is a new cross-world avatar platform that makes it easy for fans and collectors to embody their avatars in immersive web2 and web3 platforms, and connect with their communities. We automate all platform-specific integrations, such as coding, rigging, file conversions and API & SDK connections, making it simple to use a unique physical or digital collectible (such as NFTs, sneakers, trading cards and more), generated based on unique traits, as an avatar across platforms. Our Bounce Tag uses active encryption NFC to ensure a secure and permanent link between authentic physical goods and their digital counterparts.\n\n- Learn more about Bounce - [letsbounce.gg](http://www.letsbounce.gg/)\n\n## Bounce partnerships with avatar communities\n\nA great example of how Bounce can help engage and activate a web3 community is our recent partnership with Wassies. Bounce allows the Wassies community to enjoy their fridge-dwelling creatures in new ways, from face filters on Snap and Instagram, to custom avatars on VR Chat, and create unique HD renders of their Wassie. \n\nWassies on Bounce can be viewed by everyone, holders can bounce their held ones, and CC0 Wassies are available for everyone to bounce.\n\nResponse from the Wassies community has been great, and the team has created a series of engaging events on Twitter and VR Chat that brought together fans and holders to play games, show off their unique renders and wassify their socials. \n\nBelow is footage from a Wassies concert in VRChat this weekend, powered by the Bounce VRChat integration.  \n![Wassie Event](https://baunsu.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/nouns/wassiesEvent.gif)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Microsite for Bounce collab with Wassies](https://beta.letsbounce.gg/wassies)\n- [Wassies announcement tweet](https://twitter.com/bywassies/status/1709554217331949818) (41.4k impressions)\n- [Wassies VRChat event](https://twitter.com/bywassies/status/1710625261178228794)\n\n## The Team\n\nBounce is developed by Barak & Jasper, experienced creative technologists and builders in web3. Previously, they worked together at a Japanese art collective, [teamLab](https://www.teamlab.art/), and in 2021 they co-founded [Strata](https://www.strata.gallery/), a digital art incubator.  At Strata, they developed [DenDekaDen](https://www.dendekaden.com/) with Toei Animation (the Japanese animation studio behind One Piece and Dragon Ball Z).\n\n- More on [Barak](https://twitter.com/barakchamo)\n- More on [Jasper](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasper-degens-7269a256/)\n\n",

          "description": "# HEAR YE, HEAR YE!!!\n\nI think it's time to add a \"Person\" to the nouns daily rounds. What better persona than Nounye West. Love him or hate him. He is by far one of the most successful, iconic, creative minds of our time. What artist do you know can throw a listening party for an unfinished album last minute, and sell it out? He created a whole new lane musically... Fathering in such artist as Kid Cudi, Tyler The Creator, and Travis Scott to name a few. Can you imagine if the real Ye caught wind of his Nounish Avatar?!.. He would probably want to be the only one to own it / them!.. Imagine him owning a noun, and voting on proposals. He would have a million things to say; and ideas for said props. What if he were to wear an actual pair of noggles! How much would that world wide exposure be worth in ETH to nouns? Well... I used to create custom clothing for a lot of artist to wear in video shoots, and special events, but when my Pops got sick and passed, I dropped out of the scene... And now these friends are calling again. As I noun pill them, there is a high chance I just might be seeing and working with Mr. West. \n\nI created 1 Nounye with assets that correlate to 4 of his albums, with 2 variations to choose from per album. It's up to vote which one is coolest. The idea is not to make the Nounye's part of the everyday auctions in perpetuity, but a one time only appearance. The 4 Nounye's would randomly mint one time, and that's it... Making them the rarest of rare! Keep Nouns Weird and cool ⌐◨-◨  \n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/divineopus9/d09/main/Nounye%20on%20temp.jpg\n\nhttps://x.com/divineopus9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "description": "# NounsWatch: Nouns Iconic cc0 Timepieces ⌐◨-◨ ⌚ (V2)\n\n# \n\n# tldr\n1. **Why funding a NounsWatch?**\n    - **Cultural Capital**: In the digital age, physical products with a cultural and fashion statement become powerful tools of social reach and influence. They serve as “physical memes,\" carrying the DAO's brand and ideals into new spaces.\n    - **Leveraging Existing Success**: Building upon the memetical success of the sunglasses, the NounsWatch diversifies the DAO's brand to new places and moments, making it more resilient and future proof.\n    - **Broader Audience**: This opens up the growing fashion watch market and audiences in numbers never reached before.\n    - **Revenue Share**: With a 10% return of sales revenue to the DAO's treasury, the NounsWatch contributes to the much need flywheel spin.\n    - **Open Source Legacy**: By making the blueprints and digital models public domain (CC0), the project stands to benefit the broader community, true to NounsDAO open-source nature.\n2. **What is the NounsDAO funding covering?**\n    - The partially done product development.\n    - The minimum order quantity of 1000 watches (Dwiss will cover overproduction)\n    - The launch campaign.\n    - The team compensation ensuring the project’s success from inception to market.\n3. **What is the Go-to-Market Strategy?**\n    - Position the NounsWatch collection in the prominent affordable fashion watch segment.\n    - Run a Pre-sale discount Drop on Indiegogo massive 10 million people audience.\n    - Continue selling on Shopify.\n    - Run Influence Marketing and User Generated Content campaigns.\n    - Keep on building.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qj6bN2J.png)\n\n# A new hero product for Nouns\n\nThe NounsWatch serves as a new, tangible interface for the Nouns brand. Designed to be worn day and night, it reaches places that the Noggles glasses can't. This watch represents a powerful demonstration of what the Nouns community can achieve, extending the brand's narrative into an entirely new realm of self-expression. It seamlessly combines nounishness and horology, on the verge of becoming **the most personal and novel product Nouns has ever created**.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PleFEx9.png)\n## The NounsWatch cc0 design: accessible to everyone\n\nCreated by renowned watch designer Rafael Miranda, the bold Noggle-inspired design is **half a watch and half a ⌐◨-◨**, literally. And like all nounish things should be, it’s cc0!\n\n\n\nIt's as much about functionality as it is about meticulous attention to detail. It features an exquisite *mysterious hours* full day half display, with a glass mirror and a black dial. The hour and minute handles are individual pieces that combines every hour to form the Noggles symbol. On the NounsWatch, **every hour is Noun O'Clock!**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NC00WLn.gif)\n\n## The most personal Nouns product yet\n\nExplore a diverse range of personalization options with the interchangeable straps. Choose from 8 solid colors for the body and straps, or select one of the 8 available Nouns Accessory-themed straps. With 128 unique combinations, the NounsWatch will fits various styles.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9ptDzga.png)\n\n## First Prototypes\n\nTo demonstrate our unwavering commitment to the project, not only have we developed two 3D-printed prototypes, as shown below, but we've also field-tested the product for comfort and fit on the wrists. Just imagine how stunning these will look when adorned with the final production finish and colorful straps! Watch the prototype live in video: [here](https://x.com/rsmiranda/status/1714557390241059120?s=20) and [here.](https://x.com/fabioseva/status/1714901327631843711?s=46&t=OnA_W289RIsplarDuhpSrg)\nNote: The current brand identity will be revised for production version.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PekUrdI.png)\n\n## Final Product Specs\n\n**Case:** Injected Polycarbonate, 42 mm x 42 mm x 6 mm.\n**Movement:** Japanese.\n**Dial**: Exquisite half display reading system, black dial with contrasting numbers.\n**Glass:** Mineral glass with anti-reflective coating. \n**Strap:** Soft Silicone.\n**Water resistance:** Yes (3ATM)\n\n---\n\n# Dwiss: a decade of innovation\n\nDWISS - the manufacturer - is a niche watch brand founded in 2011 by Rafael Miranda, a former professor of watch design in Milan, Italy. His accolades include several design awards and publications in the watch industry.\n\nThe brand is committed to craft distinctive timepieces that stands out with innovative designs and groundbreaking features, including the use of pioneering materials and early adoption of web3 technology such as cryptocurrency, NFTs and metaverse experiences in the watch space.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/p8gK5Fi.png)\n\n![](https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1694722112/t9ce7v5l3t52g3azgydp.png)\n\n![](https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1694722042/xhyf0mdtyqkfiip0plmr.jpg)\n\n\n## Contemporary distribution methods\n\nDWISS also excels in modern distribution methods. Leveraging the power of crowdfunding and Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) strategies, launching multiple campaigns and mastering influencer and digital advertising. These accomplishments attest to DWISS's strong marketing and sales capabilities, setting a **solid foundation for the success of our Go-to-Market strategy for NounsWatch**.\n\nCrowdfunding campaigns that generated more than USD $1.5 million.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/U5gHT6Y.png)\n\nDwiss have a portfolio of influencers that have millions of followers especially in Youtube, but also instagram, facebook, blogs and magazines.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JS08Qcu.png)\n\nDwiss masters Digital Advertising, generating 9.4 millions of impressions, and 109k clicks in 2023 alone.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f3G84AV.png)\n\n---\n\n# A unparalleled opportunity to reach a new audience\n\nWe meticulously planned a winning Go-to-Market Strategy to make the most of it with optimal resources. **The NounsWatch collection seizes an unparalleled opportunity of introducing Nouns to a whole new audience.** \n\n## Step 0: Entering the Affordable Fashion Market\n\nIn an industry that generated over $70 billion in 2022, fashion ranks as the second most significant reason people wear watches, trailing only behind timekeeping. This largely accounts for why the fashion watch segment records the highest annual unit sales in the tens of millions. **The NounsWatch collection pricing and style aims to secure a position in the largest portion of this growing segment: the sub-$200 fashion watch market.**\n\nThat said, time to sell.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DprKVhF.png)\n\n## Step 1: A pre-sale shortcut to meet 10 Million customers on Indiegogo\n\nA common challenge to IRL products is meeting the minimum order quantities (MOQ) whilst ensuring enough demand for the product. And for custom designed watches, the MOQ of 1000 pieces makes the equation a bit challenging. \n\nThanks to Dwiss successful track record on Indiegogo campaigns we can have a reputable access to create a Drop.\n\nAn Indiegogo Drop is an exclusive offer for qualified business that serves a discount pre-sale channel without the need for the regular crowdfunding. The highlight is the added layer of marketing to reach the fullest of Indiegogo’s 10 million monthly visitors and 1 million combined social media followers from 235 countries.\n\nDwiss will launch a NounsWatch Drop pre-sale for the price of ~~$189.00~~ $129.00 with [teaser videos and images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7ZsbPHqzFw) that will feature Nouns on the homepage of the Indiegogo website, as well as in related content such as carousels, newsletters, and social media.\n\n**By doing so, we aim to generate sufficient demand for NounsWatch, particularly from outside the Nouns and watchmaking communities, thus bringing it closer to mainstream media and markets.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/exRMxAh.png)\n\n## Step 2: Continuous sale on the NounsWatch Shopify store\n\nAfter the presale window concludes, sales will resume in our website [nounswatch.com](http://nounswatch.com/) for $189.00 ($169.00 for selected communities), where we will accept both fiat currency and cryptocurrency. Leveraging the same proven digital marketing strategy that Dwiss employs for its products, we are going to use a share of the sales profit in Digital Advertising to generate millions of impressions and drive hundreds of thousands of clicks to our website, until the point of delivery and after. If demand falls short, Dwiss name is in play. We bear the risk and will undertake the responsibility of selling the product.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jIsZVSV.jpg)\n\n## Step 3: Ding-dong! Delivery Time\n\nUpon receiving the initial shipment from the factory, we'll start fulfilling orders through both Indiegogo and Shopify channels. At the same time, we'll ramp up our marketing efforts to stimulate new demand, focusing on a broad [influencer campaign and a user-generated content initiative](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5h5gh3ZqPzjm_Rrt6FKdrTbbJ00IF9Es). **This is a pivotal moment for the NounsWatch and Nouns history, and we are committed to maximizing its impact.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wztkALV.png)\n\n## Step 4: The NounsWatch Legacy\n\n**Spin the Flywheel (new!)**\nRegardless the supply, **10% of every NounsWatch collection sales revenue will be sent back to the Treasury** and submitted to Propdates. Assuming a pre-sale sold-out of 1000 pieces, the gross revenue would be $129,000. 10% of this ($12,900) goes back to the DAO treasury, further reducing the actual costs to the DAO. Sales out of the pre-sale window generate more revenue.\n\n**Release the IP (new!)**\nThe NounsWatch blueprint and 3d files **will be cc0, fully available on the public domain**.\n\n**Everyday, forever (new!)**\nThe objective for NounsWatch is not to exist as a limited edition, but rather to establish it as a standard product in the Dwiss partnership lineup. **We will sustain production for as long as consumer demand remains**, and may release new straps, models, and features when deemed appropriate.\n\n**Warranty and Customer Support**\nDwiss will provide a world-class ongoing support and warranty for customers after 2 years they have purchased NounsWatch.\n\n---\n\n## **Funds Allocation**\n\nWe have meticulously planned the budget to ensure optimal allocation of funds across all critical aspects of the project. Our financial strategy for V2 has been redesigned to sustain our competitive pricing strategy while accommodating the increased workload of the team until the sales take-off. \n\nWe have estimated the financial requirements for the NounsWatch project as follows:\n\n- $5,000 - Development\n- $90,000 - NounsWatch and straps (1,000 pieces)\n- $10,000 - Packaging\n- $25,000 - External Labor and Taxes\n- $14,000 - First-Class Video and 3D Production (third-party services)\n- $7,000 - Indiegogo Drop Paid Feature Package\n- $18,000 - Team Compensation\n\n**TOTAL ASK: $169,000 USDC**\nWallet: [dwiss.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x80b0b325D6A1E19953dFffb6Cc117263916796F8)\n\n## Timeline\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UK7lhJP.png)\n\n---\n\n## Team\n\n[Fabio Seva](https://x.com/fabioseva) - Concept & Marketing\nLilNoun#125, nouns-pilled founder of [Public Good Beer](https://twitter.com/publicgoodbeer?s=21&t=OnA_W289RIsplarDuhpSrg)\n[Rafael Miranda](https://x.com/rsmiranda) - Design\nLilNoun#7753, watch designer and Dwiss founder\n[Dwiss](https://x.com/dwisswatch) - Production and operations\n\n---\n\n**Acknowledgments:** we would like to thank the dozens of comments we received during V1, which enabled us to develop this new version. By participating in this project, the DAO is not just 'spending' on a product but making a strategic investment in invaluable brand equity. This intangible value—captured through consumer engagement, social influence, and expanded market reach—is an asset that can far outlive the investment, providing a return that is difficult to quantify. It’s important to understand that the full impact of this investment will unfold over time, requiring a level of trust in the project’s long-term vision and execution.",

          "description": "# Bright Any Colors with ⌐◨-◨ Noggles Jack Events\n\n# Bright Any Colors with ⌐◨-◨ Noggles Jack Events\n\n![](https://eibakatsu.com/bac/1.png)\n\n## TL;DR\n- “Bright Any Colors” embodies the meaning that every individual shines to their potential.\n\n- We will be hosting a charity event “Bright Any Colors with ⌐◨-◨” will be held for the first time at a closed elementary school in Nagoya on Saturday, December 23, 2023.\nThis event is a networking event where we discuss the role of technology in an era of “pluralism” with participants. People involved in seemingly different fields, such as social contribution organizations and the web3 community, will gather together with the aim of creating new support and revenue methods that combine social problem solving and web3.\n\n- Simultaneously with the charity event, we will be hosting “Noggles Jack Nagoya” and the “web3 Community Exhibition,” expecting over 1,000 attendees. In line with the event, there will be talk sessions, Nouns' booths, workshops, promotional merchandise distributions, and planned social contribution activities.\n\n- Prior to the event, we will have a booth for Nouns at the Design Festa in Tokyo on Sunday, November 12, 2023. Following our previous Proposal 228 “Noggles Jack Tokyo,” this will be our second event where we will display and sell Nouns merchandise. Moreover, we will also be promoting “Bright Any Colors with ⌐◨-◨.”\n\n## Background & Challenges\n- While individuals possess various facets, society often fails to accept them, because it's easier to manage by measuring everyone against a uniform set of values, leading to a tendency to avoid complexity.\nI believe that the biggest societal issue lies in the attempt to oversimplify intricate matters. Many people in today's society are bound by existing frameworks, having forgotten how to create new concepts and systems on their own accord.\n\n- The utilization of web3 technology for societal transformation is in an trial phase, but leveraging Nouns' autonomous decentralized system has the potential to assist.\nThere's a need for support towards technology that encourages “pluralistic” decision-making and collaboration, as well as the activities that accompany it.\n\n- In October 2022, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities pointed out that Japan's education for persons with disabilities is lagging behind and made [recommendations.](https://docstore.ohchr.org/SelfServices/FilesHandler.ashx?enc=6QkG1d%2FPPRiCAqhKb7yhsox6sZe%2Fik6d3iDJzISRPhvIaActFR9I%2FAIZ%2Be8dEYc3x9pGI%2BAqnUjiYnhf%2BzLRJLqW2mBzZdcaW0%2B10tvwrA97qOnmCuV89Qwl7dhkmc1B) However, there has been still no progress in understanding and awareness of disabilities, and the separation of special needs education from regular classes has been seen as a problem.\nFurthermore, research and studies on rare and congenital diseases are struggling due to the influence of market principles and an emphasis on efficiency.\n\n- “Bright Any Colors” is aimed at supporting individuals with disabilities, children, and students. Participants will be able to exchange opinions within the event, increasing the potential for new ideas and solutions to emerge.\n\n## Theme & Objectives\n“Bright Any Colors with ⌐◨-◨” aims to enjoyably learn about DAOs through Nouns, aspiring to pave the way for a future where everyone shines their brightest. Our passion for enhancing the lives of all resonates with the public, and we've designed this event hoping that the concepts and systems of web3 naturally gain broader recognition. Relying on the insights and experiences from this endeavor, we will continuously engage in activities that leverage web3 technology to address societal challenges. We will host events 3-4 times a year, striving for widespread awareness and education.\n\n## Event Overview\n### Dec 23, 2023 Event & Workshop\n![](https://eibakatsu.com/bac/2.png)\n\n- **A talk session will be held on the stage of the gymnasium.**\nOur special guests for this event will be Ms. Chizuru Azuma, an actor who has been actively involved in social contribution activities for over 30 years, and Mr. paji, a research expert in DAO and Co-Planner at pNouns.\nThe theme will be an explanation of the full-fledged DAO \"Nouns\" and its applicability to social issues.\n　\nFor example…the funding mechanism by Nouns DAO What is \"Treasury Wallet\"?\nWe'll introduce its structure, potential applications, and other real-life examples, all tailored for beginners.\nNouns-related images and videos will be projected using a projector into the visual stage production.\n\n- **Booth exhibition by social contribution organizations.**\nWe will introduce initiatives by organizations supporting people with disabilities, children, and students, as well as employment support facilities, as well as sell products and conduct educational activities.\n\n- **Invited event company \"NFT COLOR\" together the actively active web3 community in Japan Exhibiting NFT art works,** introducing the community, and interacting with social contribution organizations.\n\n### Event Proposal\n#### Various Workshops\n![](https://eibakatsu.com/bac/3.png)\n\nMs. Chizuru Azuma is in charge of the planning, composition, casting, direction, costume design, and overall supervision of the [“MAZEKOZE Island Tour,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waK22pnvFRY) which is being streamed worldwide as one of the events of the “Tokyo 2020 NIPPON Festival.”\n\n[Using the theatrical arts to create a more diverse society](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waK22pnvFRY) | Chizuru Azuma | TEDxKyoto\n\n### Location\n#### Nagono Campus\n![](https://eibakatsu.com/bac/4.png)\n[\"Nagono Campus\"](https://nagono-campus.jp/englishguide/) is located in Nagoya City, Aichi Prefecture.\n\n### Phase\n![](https://eibakatsu.com/bac/5.png)\n\n### Advatages of simultaneous event in Tokyo and Nagoya\n![](https://eibakatsu.com/bac/6.png)\n\nAt the event \"Noggles Jack Tokyo\" held on May 20th and 21st, 2023, Nouns became widely known to the general public through Noggles.\nAt the charity event \"Bright Any Colors with ⌐◨-◨,\" we will set up a \"Noggles Jack Nagoya\" booth.\nJust like last time, attendees can enjoy Nouns characters and Noggles.

Episode 2 will also be the first multi-client droposal in collaboration with Nounsagora. Droposal will come soon.*\n\n### Tl;dr:\nThis specific prop is seeking funding to create **Episode 3, 4 & 5 with a run-time of 10.5-11 mins each** delivered within 240 days.\n\n#### What is Atrium?\nAtrium is a crypto-native network of independent artists and creators. Disciplines represented on Atrium currently include Screenwriting, Animation, Concept Art, VFX, Voice Actors, and Music production. Together, creatives on Atrium bring the best ranging experiences from **Pixar, Marvel, Luma Pictures, Sony, Netflix & many more.**\n\n---\n### Proposal Ask:\n 1,125,000 (375K X 3) USD for a time-period of 240 days.\n\n> Note: *Ask is following the funding breakdown shared in the original kick-off [proposal 245](https://nouns.wtf/vote/245).*  \n\n#### Proposal timeline progress\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/wBLDJgz6/3244.png)\n\n#### Why Ask for 3 episodes at once?\n- Working on 3 month-long milestones at a time was tuned in to showcase proof-of-work to DAO and drive accountability forward.\n\n\n- Since then [Nouns Movie](https://twitter.com/nounsmovie) team has led by example, on what it means to be transparent in production process and keeping community at large in the loo.\n\n\n- What we realised however, this introduced inefficiency in securing long-term senior talent to be available to work on the film as they have no guarantee on whether they will still be working on the film after 3 months (*for e.g. followup proposals not passing*). We are often competing against traditional studio contracts for senior talent.\n  \n- Funding 3 episodes upfront will enable us to introduce batching of tasks for pre-production and animation, making the process much more predictable to manage. \n\n\n- More funding committed for the film will enable us to pre-empt discussions with distribution partners who will have a clearer picture of financing on the project and high likelihood of it being fully completed once they commit.\n\n---\n#### Where will the funds go to?\n- **Story and Scripting** for the Episode 3, 4 & 5 \n- **Preview Work in Progress and BTS** delivered through out the proposal duration\n- **Finished Episode 3,4 & 5** - delivered by 240 days time period.\n- Propdates published all along the way.\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r19IfQTw3.png)\n\n\nAs we continue production, the timeline becomes more efficient and shrinks, ultimately leading us to the film conclusion. \n\n#### Kickoff Notes for EP3 onwards\n- After Episode 2 release, the team will be on a short hiatus for the rest of November (2 weeks).\n- Team ramps back up slowly throughout month of December and sporadic availability due to holiday month.\n- Expected to fully iron out EP3 script during this time period.\n- Team back at full capacity starting January and full production loop resumes. \n---\n\n### Recap and Progress Updates so far\nYou can follow Ep2 Propdates [here](https://www.updates.wtf/prop/317). \n\n![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/2/2415348f7943c8a429024b648b3eb68b24a0d7fa_2_1380x862.jpeg)\n\n**Tl;dr:** Its bolder, bigger and better! \n\n\n#### Cast Announcements so far\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/1zVh9NsW/19.png)\n\n- [Elijah Fox](https://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1701347725407838288) (Voice of Gi)\n- [Lisa Stanley](https://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1656100844763496448) (Voice of Mrs Waxman)\n- [Ray Hurd](https://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1710009700341928121) (Voice of Go)\n- [Cesar Romero](https://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1711863323967578591) (Voice of Leader blunt)\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/253cSV1K/environment-factory-hallyway.png)\n#### Behind the Scenes\n- [Discourse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8E_7XtzU47c&ab_channel=AtriumAnimation) with the directors : How Nouns Movie enabled them to do something unthinkable, completely remotely.\n- Understanding the intricacies of Blus [Musical Score](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4OavIimoXs&ab_channel=AtriumAnimation).\n- Fun Trivia about the world [sound design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7umbTCiMTmk&ab_channel=AtriumAnimation) with Jordan - our SFX Lead.\n\n#### First Casting call\n- Casting call complete. 15 characters from other Nouns-values aligned communities were selected to make cameo appearances through out the Episode 2.\nhttps://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1686797509765840896\n- We intend to do more of these along to way opening the world of Blus outwards for others to participate in.\n\n#### Team Expansion Announcements\n- Dan Waters\nhttps://twitter.com/nounsmovie/status/1693785090340643078\n\n\n### DApp / UI Updates\n- **Nouns.Movie** was created to publish the story (dedicated webapp built with minting UX on top of Zora & cumulative leaderboard built-in)\n- Added Multi-episode support. \n- Introduced Worldview mints: Inexpensive art mints from different locations from the world of Blus that adds to cumulative ranking on the leaderboard.\n- Dedicated Behind the scenes section for audience to watch and explore auxillary content.\n- Planned token-gating for streaming content.\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/1Xd6YyB7/11111.png)\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/fTsHzvSg/2222.png)\n\n---\n\n### Story Updates\n**Genre**: Action, Comedy\n\nScript for the delivered Episode 2 can be found [***here***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gdInCNXaLvKA5Vrxe6aCTiOtE67jNpG6/view?usp=sharing)\n\n*We also created a rough outline of how the story progresses through completion.

          "description": "# Nouns Council for the Digital Arts\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nAs collectors, we hold a degree of skepticism regarding the impact of a single artistic niche. We contend that despite the existence of various sub-DAOs, none of them are exclusively dedicated to cultivating the connections and inspiration vital for artists to actively and substantially engage in the Nouns ecosystem. Few subcommunity initiatives manage to captivate the interest of potential new members. The insights from esteemed artists, whom we deeply respect, have contributed to the prominence of several communities and projects. We aim to bring this prominence to Nouns while emphasizing the priority of advancing digital art.\n\n## Overview\n\nDigital art currently finds itself diminished in the broader artistic discourse, prompting our dedication to effecting change this scenario. We aspire to propel digital art to a pervasive state. The establishment of the Nouns Council for the Digital Arts emerges as a strategic initiative designed to cultivate widespread appreciation for digital art, fostering education and adoption on a global scale as we support the artists behind it.\n\n*“We're favored to have an exceptional team, and together within Nouns Community we're poised to create a lasting legacy in the history of digital art.”*\n\n***\n## Team\n\nThe concept behind the concept\n\n*\"So I said 'What if we created something very provocative?\"*\n\n*\"A sanctuary for artists, but in its broadest interpretation, also a work of art, a creation, and a catalyst for meaningful discourse.\"*\n\n*\"What degree of intrigue generated by anonymity can truly be leveraged as a potent tool? What is the equilibrium of anonymity? Satoshi Nakamoto's execution in this regard was remarkable.\"*\n\nNote: The project's creators have chosen to maintain their anonymity, prioritizing a focus on the project's message and artistic vision rather than individual recognition.\n\n**Advisors Description;**\n\nLeaders of the art community, tastemakers, builders, advisors, critics, curators, community supporters and industry art partners.\n\n• [Noah](https://x.com/cryptopunknoah)\nPrev Brand Lead [CryptoPunks](https://x.com/cryptopunksnfts) and Contemporary Art Specialist [Christie’s](https://x.com/christiesinc) & Founder and Artist [Howlerz](https://x.com/howlerznft)\n\n**• [Alejandro Cartagena](https://twitter.com/halecar2)** \nCo-founder and Artist of [Fellowship](https://x.com/fellowshiptrust) & [Obscura](https://x.com/obscuradao). Works in the SFMoMA, JPMorgan, MFAH, MoCP, National Gallery, and the Getty Museum collections.\n\n**• [Sebastian Sanchez](https://twitter.com/sebastianss527)**\nDigital Art at [Christie’s](https://twitter.com/christiesinc)\n\n**• Advisor in deliberation.**\n\n**Community Manager Description;**\n\n**• [Multi](https://x.com/multivrsstudios)** \nCommunity Moderator at Beeple & XCOPY. Former Community Manager at [Async Art](https://x.com/asyncart)\n\n**Strategic Guest Description;** \n\n**• [Patrick Amadon](https://x.com/patrickamadon)** \nRenowned for his digital glitch art, with a focus on countercultural themes. Patrick initially started as a traditional painter and transitioned to digital art around 2012. He gained recognition for manipulating image files of paintings and photographs, creating captivating animated loops. Patrick is an incredibly influential and powerful voice in the art world.\n\n**Curators Description;**\n\nThe selection of two curators for this project is currently under deliberation.\n\n*“Mentorship and curation is key for these programs to work. You need a way to see the funds are being fruitful in offering space for dedicated experimentation. I´ve been part of many grant programs and this is the difference between giving away money, and building a solid art program everyone wants to be a part of.”* - [Alejandro Cartagena](https://x.com/halecar2)\n***\n\n## Nounish Moviment\n\nAt the heart of this movement is art, a robust network that isn't assessed by the sheer quantity of connections but by the depth and quality of those connections. It places a premium on authenticity over superficiality, sincerity over pretense, and genuine engagement over mere presence.\n\nSolid networking within the artistic community recognizes the power of reciprocity, where giving and contributing to your network leads to receiving in return. It nurtures a sense of community where individuals support each other's aspirations, exchange ideas, and create opportunities. This movement is grounded in that when one artist prospers, the entire network reaps the benefits.\n\nThe Nouns Council for the Digital Arts extends its influence across various domains. In the realm of knowledge, it fuels innovation and sparks fresh collaborative dialogues. In the world of arts, it propels the creation of innovative works through interdisciplinary partnerships.\n\nThis movement transcends the pursuit of extensive proliferation; it's about valuing quality and the long term, stability over flux, unity over division. It's about the enchantment that blossoms when diverse minds come together to pursue shared objectives.\n\nAs we navigate this digital age, the Nouns Council for the Digital Arts serves as a reminder that art embodies an authentic movement and the most robust foundation for connections. It underscores the enduring value of impactful, long-term construction. In a world teeming with artists, this movement upholds the notion that art serves as both the point of origin and the ultimate destination, the bedrock of our triumph and contentment.\n\n## Rationale\n\nFinance a program/council that establishes a foundation for other projects with the aim of promoting art and providing a secure space for artists and digital art. (1) aesthetic diversification beyond the illustrative premise, (2) create a culture where the meme is implemented and placed in solid proliferation.\n\n*“What moves men of genius, or rather what inspires their work, is not new ideas, but their obsession with the idea that what has already been said is still not enough.”*\n\\- Eugene Delacroix\n\n## 1. Aesthetic diversification beyond the illustrative premise\n\nThe world of digital art is currently undergoing a significant and innovative transformation. At its core lies the meme – a seemingly straightforward yet incredibly adaptable form of cultural expression. It appears as a flaw to me that the art within Nouns is predominantly characterized by an illustrative premise or animations. Memes are inherently multifaceted, effortlessly adjusting to diverse cultural contexts, languages, and trends. As such, the meme stands as an artistic formula that transcends boundaries, championing inclusivity and encouraging artists from various backgrounds to engage.\n\n*“I really appreciate the idea of Nouns pushing into different art styles.”*\n\\- [willpapper](https://x.com/willpapper) (nouner)\n\n*“i'm generally here for us diversifying the way nouns shows up”*\n\\- [Jesse Pollak](https://x.com/jessepollak) (nouner)\n\n*“I think showing the diversity of nouns brand to go beyond cute characters”*\n\\- [brennen](https://x.com/brennen_eth) (nouner)\n\n*Case study; Sensuality in Art.* \n\nOn the heels of [Prop 392’s](https://nouns.wtf/vote/392) The theme of sensuality, chosen for its delicate nature, served as a canvas for interpretation and became the subject of data research to understand the meme's applicability and the community's perspective on such sensitivity. \n\n*“It is highly gratifying to witness the execution of the initial objective and the impact it generated, similar to major discussions such as fork and burn, the community's interest and the division of opinions regarding nounish applications in art is remarkable. The feedback provided, along with the articles published, has been deeply valued and considered in shaping our overall narrative. We have read each one with great appreciation.”*\n\n## 2. A culture where the meme is implemented and placed in solid proliferation.\n\n**A monthly grant for digital art.  Supports 12 Artists for 6 months, and the artist gets the prestige of being in the program. (This results in a total support of $50,000 for each artist.)**\n  * **Operational Process for monthly grant:\n\nWith the assistance of our curators, a careful selection will be made of the 12 most exceptional and inventive artists who could have nounish inspirations. These artists are anticipated to create and interpret nouns in the most unique way according to their individual artistic visions. They will produce pieces within their respective domains of art, leading to a grand exhibition at the program's conclusion.\n\n*“I'm eager to see which artists will be selected. Personally, I'm a big fan of XCOPY, and I'd be thrilled to witness one of his unique pieces inspired by Nounish.”*\n\n* **Educational Opportunities:** The program establishes an educational pathway, offering workshops and outreach initiatives that enable artists to impart their expertise and skills to the wider community. Distinguished guests also bring valuable knowledge to the artists. Spaces with guests and other artists will be held every 15 days.\n\n*“Art prevails over the artists who create it and the initiatives that sustain this ecosystem, daring to experiment extensively. While I may not possess knowledge about Nouns or NFTs, but I do have some well-formed ideas about the digital art movement that I can share. I'm here for anything you need.*”\n\\- Anne Laure ( Director Department of Externals Affairs - Musée du Louvre\n\n* **Expansion of Interest/New Members for Nouns:** Collectors are to artists they resonate with, as artists are to the art they create.\n\nIn one of our researches aligned with the created thesis, the current population of art collectors predominantly has cryptopunks in their portfolio, actively interacting with them, in addition, a significant portion of collectors express interest in any group or project that supports artists and can potentially become part of such a community.\n\nA substantial number of collectors have a comprehensive understanding of what Nouns represent, and a considerable percentage of them express disinterest because the artists in their collections are not part of such a community, this profile reflects collectors in general. Notably, there is a significant correlation between collectors participating in projects and the frequency with which artists mention them, resulting in higher levels of interactions within the space overall.\n\nEvery collector fondly remembers the initial piece they acquired, although the meaning of that first purchase is different. Many collectors make their first purchase after hearing mentions of specific projects from other collectors and artists. For a significant portion of collectors, the first piece obtained provided them access to a community that aligns with their visions and expectations of artists.\n\n*“I love nouns and loved what Dustin Yellin x Artmatr. I'm watching what's happening and seeing how it overall affects the community and market.”*\n\\- [Sebastian](https://x.com/sebastianss527) (Digital Art at Christie’s)\n\n**Nounish Friday (Weekly Artistic Celebration): Every week we acquire $2,000 of art nounish.**\n• **Operational Process for Nounish Friday**\n\nEvery Friday for six months we will announce on our twitter profile that we are selecting 3 pieces to add to the Nounish Art Vault. Each week, we will invite nouners, notable personalities, esteemed collectors, artists, critics and external guests to participate as our weekly curators. These people will have the privilege of choosing the works of the week and giving a few words about their selections, which will be published on profile every Sunday along with the chosen works. \n\nThis process represents a double honor for the artist: his creation shines under the unique choices made by our illustrious guests. The featured artists of the week will receive a guaranteed financial incentive through the selected pieces.\n\n• **Specifications;**\n\nThe Nounish Art Vault serves as a safe place where all pieces collected in Nounish Friday will be housed. This way, after the implementation of this program, we will have a vast and varied collection that can be utilized by other nounish projects, exhibitions, and in-person events organized by other builders.\n\n## CC0\n\nWe will take the initiative to acquaint artists with the significance of CC0, enabling them to decide whether their pieces will be made available under this license or not.\n\nWe hold a shared viewpoint regarding the significance of CC0 for all projects within nouns. However, we acknowledge that each artist may have a distinct perspective on this matter. This is why we opt to offer them a comprehensive introduction to the subject and grant them the autonomy to decide how it applies to their work.\n***\n## Transparently\n\nAll funds will be transparently deposited and utilized through the multisig that governs the Nouns Council for the Digital Arts.\n\n## Overall Cost\n\n$1,556,000 USDC\n\n**Budget Breakdown**\n\n**Artistry Spotlight - $654,000**\n\n* A monthly grant for Digital Art. \n\n$50k x 12 (6 months, each grant totals $50k per artists/ distributed in that period) - $600k \n\n* Nounish Friday\n\n$2k x 27 (3 pieces per week/ 6 months/ 27 Fridays) - $54k\n\n**Strategic Vision $521k / 8 months**\n\n* Advisors Fees - $320k\n  * Feedback and evaluation\n  * Communication and targeting\n  * Creative oversight\n\n\n* Curators Fees - $128k\n  * Curation and relationship with artists\n  * Overseeing and managing    \n  * Acquisitions and Deaccessioning\n  * Collection Management and Documentation\n\n* Strategic guest fees - $40k\n  * Communication traction\n  * Organic number planning\n  * Feedback and evaluation\n\n* Community Manager fees - $33k\n  * Engagement and Moderation\n  * Feedback Gathering\n  * Community Building\n\n**Management - $272k / 8 months**\n\n* Senior Managing Director - $184k\n  * Project Leadership and Planning\n  * Stakeholder Engagement\n  * Committee Assignments\n\n* Director General - $88k\n  * Relations with Galleries.\n  * Operational Oversight\n  * Performance Monitoring\n  * Risk Management\n  * Reporting and Accountability\n\n**General Operations - $109k**\n\nGallerist - $17K\nSocial Media Mgr - $20K\nLegal+Accounting - $20K\nAssistant - $22K\nWeb build and upkeep - $30K\n***\n## Timeline\n\n**Nounish Friday (Weekly Artistic Celebration)**\n\n• November/December 2023: Team preparation, promotional activities, and artist call commence.\n\n• January 5, 2024: Program initiation, with the first event on the first Friday of the month.\n\n• Ongoing from January 2024: Weekly cycles of activities to maintain continual engagement with both artists and the community, ensuring a organic growth and dynamic and vibrant program.\n\n**A monthly grant for digital art**\n\n• November/December 2023: Curatorship commences the selection process for participating artists.\n\n• January 20, 2024: Announcement of the selected artists, accompanied by short video presentations.\n\n• January 2024 to June 2024: Six months of comprehensive mentoring provided to the chosen artists by our advisors and curators.\n\n• June 2024: Conclusion of the 6-month program. Artists delivery their projects, and a new proposal will be submitted to Nouns to organize the main event, where these works will be showcased alongside Droposal.\n\n*“That idea sounds definitely awesome! I think given the fact that Nouns holds substantial funds (+their reach and reputation within the community) it would be a great way to support artists, and art, with its substantial number of collectors, contributes to the Nouns ecosystem. Web3 at it's peak has been allowing artists (myself included) to work on their passion and improve their skills without monetary issues pressing us into crap jobs with crap clients. Everyone receiving this kind of support will definitely benefit from t.”*\n\\- [Stefan Grobe Halbuer](https://x.com/grossehalbuer) (President of Purple)\n\n*“I’m not that deeply embedded in the Nouns community, but this project is truly awesome.”*\n\\- [Kayvon](https://x.com/saturnial) (CEO, Co-founder Foundation)\n\n*“It is a great idea. can you explain me better the Nouns? I dont know it.”*\n\\- [Hackatao](https://x.com/hackatao) (Decentralized OG Artist Duo)\n\n*“Hey this and ideas like it are awesome - I dont have a noun but can hang and help out.”*\n\\- [Pindar Van Arman](https://x.com/vanarman) (AI Artist, creator of bitGANs)\n\n## Conclusion \n\nIn the endeavor to create a program like this, there are multiple considerations that should guide its structure. One key factor to bear in mind is the delicate balance between financial support and the prestige associated with participation. These two elements often intertwine to make such programs successful. Therefore, it is essential to recognize that artists, at various stages of their careers, have distinct needs when it comes to funding and recognition.\n\nFor emerging artists who are just beginning their journey, the appeal of participation and the prestige it brings can be more critical than receiving substantial funding. Their participation adds a sense of freshness and vitality to the program, contributing to its overall appeal. This synergy benefits both the emerging artists and the program itself, creating a dynamic and mutually beneficial relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, more established artists may require a more substantial financial injection into their projects. These artists often carry ambitious visions that necessitate a greater level of funding. Their involvement brings a wealth of experience and influence to the program, further enhancing its reputation.\n\nAs we consider the program's structure, it is prudent to adopt a tiered system of support that caters to the diverse needs of artists. Such a model should not only address the artists' requirements but also leverage the network effect. The network effect relies on the concept that having fewer established artists can generate significant prestige for the program, while having a larger number of emerging artists strengthens the perception of the program as a staunch supporter of the arts.\n\nIn our perspective, a balanced distribution that favors a higher number of emerging artists can serve as a robust and equitable model. It bolsters the emergence of fresh talent and ensures a steady influx of innovative ideas. Simultaneously, it can leverage the prestige generated by established artists to further enhance the program's reputation and reach.\n\nThis project should aim to find the equilibrium between these elements, fostering an environment where emerging and established artists can coexist and thrive. By recognizing the distinct funding and prestige requirements at various career stages, we can create a program that resonates with both artists and the broader artistic community, ultimately enhancing the vibrancy and sustainability of the arts.\n\n## What comes next?\n\nUpon the program's completion, we will draft a new proposal for the main event, extending an invitation to the entire NFT community to experience the artworks of the 12 selected artists. This proposal will outline the event's execution.\n\n\\+ \n\nIn the future, following the completion of this program, we aspire to delve deeper into the narrative. We plan to create a documentary about the selected artists, exploring their backgrounds, inspirations, and gathering their thoughts on the experience of being part of this program. “The Council\" will be a 12-part documentary, with each episode dedicated to the story of one of the artists featured in the program. \n\nOur concept of art is deeply entwined with individual identity, a driving force behind much of cultural enthusiasm. In this endeavor, we aim to expand and emphasize the influence of personal history. While there is a wealth of knowledge about the artist's work, we seek to uncover the person behind these creations. What inspires them, and what is their creative process like? What is their life story?\n\n\"The Council\" is a unique exploration of creativity. By delving into each artist's identity and artistic journey, we hope to uncover something more profound. This involves masterfully navigating the intricacies of their craft while staying connected to universal themes through a personal perspective. It's quite remarkable to consider how humans have transformed art into an extension of the revolutionary essence of life, and art into an extension of technology.\n***\n## Steps to Implement\n\n• Establish a secure multisig. Key holders may consist of one of our advisors, a noun trusted member of the community, and one of the project creators.\n\n• Feedback provided during the 7-day period while this proposal is under candidate.\n\n• Curators' descriptions.\n\n• Description of the advisor under deliberation.\n\n",

Distribution will be digital and physical. The project development will be shared through videos, live streams, and Open Editions, aiming for completion in 10-12 months.\n\n---\n\n**UPDATE:**\nAfter some feedback I reduced the amount needed to execute this prop, just keeping strictly the necessary to make the graphic novel a reality and distribute it using the same methods. I have decreased the budget by 33%, going from 90 to 60 ETH, and swapped it to USDC.\n\n**About Noun 81:** I'm not including a txn to transfer the Noun inside the proposal.\nProf Werder is making a prop for that ([#421](https://nouns.wtf/vote/421)), I know it's a bit confusing, and it wasn't planned, but basically, if her prop passes I won't need an extra step to transfer the Noun, if not, I'll make a second prop to transfer the Noun to one of my wallets.\n\n---\n\n## **A Graphic Novel (Vol 1)**.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkNjEYyzT.png)\n*Draft Cover/Poster*\n\nI’m targeting Graphic Novel readers (15+) who love both sci-fi and fantasy + adventure, usually read action-packed stories, but also love tech, and (included but not limited) are crypto users. The artwork will include concepts related to decentralization, blockchain, and internet technologies, and Nouns will be the characters that inhabit this universe.\n\nI firmly believe that we can find the right audience in Web3 at first, it’s an amazing niche to build a tech-oriented story and ultimately an onchain mythology, in which Nouns could be not only at the core of it but represent great values and a positive-sum culture.\n\nTo me, nouns are not only pixel characters, but something more, they are storytelling vehicles full of potential. And at the same time, there are dozens of small elements in our community lore to include in the story. \n\n---\n\n## **Evolution of the Nouns aesthetics (from my POV):**\nWe all love the original Nouns, they are perfect as the source material, but they are also really adaptable to using them in different styles.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyPczHAWa.png)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJ-R9gHga.png)\n*The last two images are from April-June 2022.*\n\n In this world-building adventure, I've given the term \"Noun\" a fresh perspective, digging into its meaning both on the surface and at a deeper, symbolic level. This project isn't just about testing how Nouns look; it's also about spinning an engaging tale. We want to hook current Noun fans and introduce new readers to our world, even if they're not blockchain or DAO experts.\n \n---\n\n## **Distribution:**\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJE-Pclfa.png)\nDraft Cover.\n\n**Digital First:**\nThe main distribution strategy will be online (Free download from the website, manga/comic reader apps like Comixology, Viz Media, Kindle, and P2P/torrents).\nMost of the dedicated comic reader apps have more than 500K users minimum, but in the case of bigger apps like Comixology or Viz Media, they have millions of users combined in both the App Store and Google Store.\n\n**Physical:**\nPhysical copies will be handled through Amazon (highly efficient, global coverage, and no upfront costs). Plus, in case we can make a deal with regional publishers, it's easy to shut down the distribution of a translated version directly on Amazon.\n\n\n**2 Languages:**\nEnglish, Spanish. \n\nSince the previous prop didn't pass I'm just including 2 languages.\nWhy? Because I'm a native Spanish speaker and I usually make the story, script and most of the other elements in my own language, sure, I can use English to make everything but it's not the same and it's slower for me to work that way.\n\n---\n\n## **Concept Art:**\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJoFWSRZT.png)\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJYtXrR-a.png)\n\n---\n## **Summary of the story (subject to changes):**\n\n\nMeet Shady, a Noun who doesn't quite fit the mold of an obedient or exemplary citizen in a world teeming with adventurers, mysteries, and high achievers. His existence is a quiet rebellion in a society that prizes conformity. However, it seems destiny, if it exists, has grander designs for Shady. His insatiable curiosity catapults him into the uncharted territories of unexplored worlds.\n\nAs Shady embarks on this enigmatic journey, it becomes clear that more than just his life is at stake. The fate of his entire kind rests on his shoulders, and time is of the essence. He's faced with a dilemma: will he seize this opportunity to change the course of history or let it slip through his fingers?\n\n\n\n## **Sample Pages**\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryDRkBRWp.png)\n\n\n## **Characters from the first volume:**\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bk-7xu1zp.png)\n\n**Featuring the NounBots:**\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJVbJ9xza.png)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1nzkqeMa.png)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkRmycgM6.png)\n\n---\n\n## **Building in Public + Key Milestones:**\n\nI’m also building a graphic style to present the development of the project to the public in a more entertaining way using videos and/or live streams. This way people can follow more closely the development of the graphic novel and can ask questions about nouns and their ecosystem.\n\nThe goal is to make 2 videos per week, showing the process of the Graphic Novel, the idea is to use Twitch/YouTube, or short format videos like TikTok/Instagram.\nI can also use propdates.wtf to show the latest news of the prop and the Manga channel in Farcaster.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyO0trwWa.png)\n*This is a sample of how the videos could look like*.\n\n## **Key Milestones:**\n\n**Concept and Team (Months 1-3):**\nDevelop the storyline and artistic style.\n\n**Production and Marketing (Months 4-10):**\nCreate the 64-page graphic novel while making the videos.\nImplement marketing and promotion strategies on online platforms.\n\n**Distribution and Launch (Month 11-12):**\nPlan and execute the distribution strategy for both digital and physical copies.\nOfficially launch the graphic novel, including online and potentially in-person events.\n\n**Audience Engagement and Public Building (Ongoing):**\nContinuously engage with the community on various platforms, and introduce the videos to make updates about the progress of the Graphic Novel.\n\n**Global Expansion and Future Planning (Ongoing):**\nStart the conversations with external publishers to get the graphic novel printed around the globe.\nEvaluate the project's performance and plan for the next chapters.\n\n---\n\n## **Scope and Budget**:\nSince this is a graphic novel of 64 pages I will need around 10 to 12 months to finish it.\nThe ideal deadline would be the next Nouniversary and I’ll push myself and the team involved to do so, but I’m organizing the dates including all the team efforts and the standard timeframes to make the deadline more realistic so it could be released in October/November next year.\n\n---\n\n## **Budget Breakdown:**\n\n- **Preproduction - 7 eth**\n  - World Building\n  - Concept art \n  - Environment design\n  - Character Sheets\n  - Props Design \n- **Script - 7 eth**\n- **Art Development - 29 eth**\n  - Layouts - 6 eth\n  - Pencils - 8 eth\n  - Inks + Screentones - 11 eth\n  - Lettering + VFX/SFX - 4 eth\n- **Editorial - 4 eth**\n  - Proofreading and formatting for Spanish* and English.\n*Spanish is added because I'm writing this in my native language.\n- **Marketing and Distribution - 6 eth**\n  - Distribution through the mentioned apps and websites.\n  - Promoted content inside specialized comic websites/forums.\n  - Videos / Live Streams, to engage with the community.\n  - Web3 collectibles like Open Editions to promote the artwork.\n- **Management - 5 eth.**\n- **Website - 2 eth**\n### **Total= 60 ETH (USDC 107,750) + Noun 81**\n\n---\n\n## **It's a me, Messhup!**\nFor some of you who don't know me, let me introduce myself.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Syxp3uJfa.jpg)\n\nMy name is Messhup and I:\n* Coined the rubber hose style on Nouns [back in 2021](https://x.com/messhup/status/1468248915963265024?s=20).\n* Created the art for the [1st contest made by NounsDAO](https://x.com/undeadnoun22/status/1473463987014619138?s=20).\n* [Lost Nouns](https://lostnouns.wtf/) founding team (Onchain Nounish derivative).\n* Made the 1st Nouniversary artwork ([featured in Brave browser globally for 24H](https://x.com/messhup/status/1568715950307905539?s=20)).\n* Constructed a coloring book series ([100 days of Nouns](https://nounsense.xyz/)) in 6 months. around 260 copies sold, and 1300 downloads, which served as the main source for several contests and attracted more artists.\n* Sent the coloring books to [DesignerCon 2022](https://x.com/bigshottoyworks/status/1711235066720821657?s=20) and [Devcon Bogota](https://x.com/messhup/status/1573013727200305156?s=20).\n* Nouncil founding member ([POAP](https://x.com/messhup/status/1514437218370215938?s=20)).\n* Made [The MetaSquare](https://x.com/thenounsquare/status/1620013926049288192?s=20) for TNS.\n* Helped to raise [21+ ETH](https://juicebox.money/p/sharkfrens) to support a [Shark DAO core member](https://x.com/sharkdao/status/1487436616557809670?s=20).\n* Drew 26 covers for the [Noun O Talk podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/3zRdJbEHThDE8F5ODRnWMF).\n* Illustrated a NounsDAO banner for the [Coincenter dinner](https://x.com/apenoun/status/1535063255148003328?s=20).\n* Designed merch for a boat, pin, and tshirts for [Nouns at NFT NYC](https://x.com/fiveoceans_dev/status/1649095323988660224?s=20).\n* Created GGBot, and a current collaborator in Nouns Esports (more coming soon).\n* Made the art for [Keep Nouns Weird](https://x.com/keepnounsweird/status/1687503577667846144?s=20).\n* Created a Nounish collection called [Serial Collectors](https://opensea.io/collection/serialcollectors) (more to come).\n* Core member of [Nouns Amigos](https://x.com/NounsDAOAmigos/status/1668349764440825857?s=20) (spanish branch of Nouns)\n\n**Outside of Nouns:**\n* Collaborated with [Noadz](https://x.com/thenoadz/status/1550372389313122304?s=20) multiple times.\n* One of the first Nouns artwork in [another blockchain](https://x.com/NervosNetwork/status/1522231419921178625?s=20)*\n* Meme Seizer OE ([17K+ mints](https://opensea.io/collection/memeseizer-by-messhup)) + [Onchain narrative](https://opensea.io/collection/meme-seizer).\n* 1st Cryptoadz anniversary on Zora ([13,660+ mints](https://x.com/messhup/status/1569704877474848772?s=20)).\n* 1st Boneyversary OE ([4,700+ mints](https://opensea.io/collection/boneyversary)).\n* [POAP Checks](https://x.com/poapxyz/status/1623071331733364741?s=20) (1100+ mints in less than 2 hours).\n* Featured in the [NFT yearbook](https://x.com/nft_yearbook/status/1600486785582338049?s=20).\n* Worked with Bankless for 7 months as an illustrator.\n\nI also worked with Adidas, ExxonMobil, Penguin Random House, LEGO, and more to come.\n\nI have more than 10 years as an illustrator and I feel confident executing this project because I've been preparing this for around a year now, I'm here to stay, I'm aiming high with this prop, and I want to make an epic graphic novel that breaks into the mainstream media.

Translating the artwork can create opportunities for publication by one or multiple publishers in Europe, Asia, or North America. Since many major publishers prefer to review a complete work, and this being the first volume, it could serve as an ideal means to engage regional publishers worldwide.\n\n\n---\n\n## **Concept Art:**\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJoFWSRZT.png)\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJYtXrR-a.png)\n\n---\n## **Summary of the story (subject to changes):**\n\n\nMeet Shady, a Noun who doesn't quite fit the mold of an obedient or exemplary citizen in a world teeming with adventurers, mysteries, and high achievers. His existence is a quiet rebellion in a society that prizes conformity. However, it seems destiny, if it exists, has grander designs for Shady. His insatiable curiosity catapults him into the uncharted territories of unexplored worlds.\n\nAs Shady embarks on this enigmatic journey, it becomes clear that more than just his life is at stake. The fate of his entire kind rests on his shoulders, and time is of the essence. He's faced with a dilemma: will he seize this opportunity to change the course of history or let it slip through his fingers?\n\n\n\n## **Sample Pages**\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryDRkBRWp.png)\n\n\n## **Characters from the first volume:**\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bk-7xu1zp.png)\n\n**Featuring the NounBots:**\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJVbJ9xza.png)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1nzkqeMa.png)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkRmycgM6.png)\n\n---\n\n## **Building in Public + Key Milestones:**\n\nI’m also building a graphic style to present the development of the project to the public in a more entertaining way using videos and/or live streams. This way people can follow more closely the development of the graphic novel and can ask questions about nouns and their ecosystem.\n\nThe goal is to make 2 videos per week (1 to 2 hours each) showing the process of the Graphic Novel, the idea is to use Twitch or YouTube (ideally both).\nI can also use propdates.wtf to show the latest news of the prop and the Manga channel in Farcaster.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyO0trwWa.png)\n*This is a sample of how the videos could look like*.\n\n## Key Milestones:\n\n**Concept and Team (Months 1-3):**\nDevelop the storyline and artistic style.\nAssemble and prepare the creative team.\n\n**Production and Marketing (Months 4-10):**\nCreate the 64-page graphic novel while translating it into multiple languages.\nImplement marketing and promotion strategies on online platforms.\n\n**Distribution and Launch (Month 11-12):**\nPlan and execute the distribution strategy for both digital and physical copies.\nOfficially launch the graphic novel, including online and potentially in-person events.\n\n**Audience Engagement and Public Building (Ongoing):**\nContinuously engage with the community on various platforms.\nAdapt the project based on audience feedback and reception.\n\n**Global Expansion and Future Planning (Ongoing):**\nStart the conversations with external publishers to get the graphic novel.\nEvaluate the project's performance and plan for the next chapters.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByWvFmvG6.png)\n\n---\n\n## **Scope and Budget**:\nSince this is a graphic novel of 64 pages I will need around 10 to 12 months to finish it.\nThe ideal deadline would be the next Nouniversary and I’ll push myself and the team involved to do so, but I’m organizing the dates including all the team efforts and the standard timeframes to make the deadline more realistic so it could be released in October/November next year.\n\n---\n\n## **Budget Breakdown:**\n\n- **Preproduction -

The strategy includes increasing thoughtful spending, [testing out new mechanisms](https://w.mirror.xyz/AmHOzH-FQZVO3IhGXHSvCRxRSf2MO6VCZdmMwNEIyKE), and [rewarding Nouns to deserving contributors](https://www.nouns.camp/proposals/409).\n\nTo advance this goal, I suggest conducting trial rounds where a Noun is awarded through a Prop House round. The rounds' focus would be to bring in exceptional people who have previously contributed something meaningful in their respective fields. **Taking inspiration from [Brian Armstrong](https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1681439056323051529), the round would serve as an explicit invitation for accomplished and interesting individuals to help steward Nouns.** \n\n\n**Round parameters:**\n- A two-week period for submitting proposals.\n- A one-week period for voting.\n- Open submission for all (with basic criteria to avoid spam).\n- Voting conducted by Nouns voters.\n- The proposer with the highest votes receives one Noun.\n\n**Logistics:**\nThe nouns would be escrowed in a [2/3 safe](0xDBDD666BFa569F72866Fba319271aC008B6bbe7a) managed by trusted community members [ccarella](https://twitter.com/ccarella), [necfas](https://twitter.com/necfas) and [seneca](https://twitter.com/cryptoseneca). \n\n**Timeline:**\nIf we stick to a ~20 day timeline, we can run three rounds between November and December with the final round ending on new years day :)\n\n**The Chosen Ones:**\nArmy Pickel, Icy Snowman, Fiery Cloud\n\n![image](https://i.imgur.com/CjYhViX.png)\n\n---\n\nIf the experiment is successful in attracting worthy participants, we could consider running continuous rounds to help allocate the 500+ Nouns in the treasury. Worth noting is that if it is indeed a success, more than helping allocate Nouns, these rounds could be a sort of Nouns-wide celebration akin to noun-o-clock.",

Decked out in Noggles, experiencing Nouns stories, interacting with vibrant Nouns sculptures and characters, and immersing themselves in a world where disability, disadvantage, or illness doesn't define them. Instead, they're celebrated for their individuality and spirit, all while being introduced to the imaginative universe of Nouns. This is the magic of the Variety Kids Xmas Party, and with your support, we can make it an unforgettable experience.*\n### Introduction:\nThe Variety Kids Xmas Party is an annual event held in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia that brings joy and inclusion to over 5,000 Victorian children facing diverse challenges. We seek Nouns DAO's support of 47,479 UDSC to enhance this iconic event, held across 39,000 square metres, with the Nouns bringing the FUN and ENTERTAINMENT, ensuring a memorable experience for all attendees including:\n* 5,000 kids in need\n* 3,000 parents and carers\n* 600 corporate volunteers\n* 100 VIP guests\n\nThis year's party will be held in mid-December 2023.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SybKqjyga.jpg)\n\n### ⌐◧-◧ Background:\nFor over three decades, the Variety Kids Xmas Party has been a beacon of hope for kids in need. Held at the Melbourne Convention Exhibition Centre, this event has touched the lives of over 165,000 children since its inception in 1986. The massive event is completely FREE for 5,000 children and 3,000 carers to attend, ensuring that each child receives a gift and experiences an inclusive day of fun, activities, stage entertainment, carnival rides, all-abilities sport and an all-important visit from Santa. For many, this celebration is the only one they have during the Christmas season, and the gifts they receive at the party are often the only ones they receive. The Variety Kids Xmas Party is a safe space for children living with disabilities or experiencing disadvantage or illness, allowing them to be themselves without fear of judgment from their peers. This remarkable event is made possible by the dedication and hard work of the small Variety team and over 600 volunteers.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkJSDa1xp.jpg)\n\n\n### ⌐◧-◧ Profound Impact:\nThe Variety Kids Xmas Party is more than just a day of fun; it&#39;s a lifeline for families who often feel isolated or overlooked. For many children, the event offers a rare opportunity to experience joy, laughter, and a sense of belonging. Parents often remark on the transformative effect of the party, noting the boost in their children's confidence and self-esteem. The ripple effect extends beyond the children to their families, providing them with a much-needed respite and the chance to see their children thrive in a supportive environment. The memories created during the party serve as a source of strength and inspiration for families throughout the year.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkJ5cjkxT.jpg)\n\n### ⌐◧-◧ Testimonials:\n\"You have no idea what this means to us.

Simultaneously, community donations have become less frequent, as they are no longer as possible for some individuals as they once were.\n\nIf the Nouns prop passes to fund the 2023 event, the money previously allocated for it will be redirected to our individual grant program, which provides essential items like wheelchairs, communication devices, scholarships, education programs and assistance dogs for kids experiencing disadvantage or living with conditions including Cerebral Palsy, Down Syndrome, Autism, global development delay, muscular dystrophy, brain\ninjury, spinal injury, rare and chronic disease and more.\n\nVariety – the Children’s Charity requests a total of USDC 47,479 to fund the Nouns brand fun and entertainment zones.

[Ongoing Support and Maintenance](#ongoing-support-and-maintenance)\n\n---\n\n## 📖 Introduction\nA Unique Opportunity for Nouns DAO to fund an experience uniquely centered around Nouns. Focused primarily on engaging children, the app aims to be a playground where Nouns are at the core of fun, interactive, and educational activities. This will be achieved through a scavenger hunt, encouraging movement, exploration, and learning in a delightful manner.\n\nWe propose a funding request of 35,000 USDC to expand the Nouns Capture app, an interactive scavenger hunt that educates school-aged students globally about Nouns and key Web 3 concepts in a fun and engaging way. Currently available for iOS, our expansion plan includes developing an Android version of the app, a worldwide launch to tens of thousands of school students globally, and full connected curriculum integration.\n\n## 🌈 Nouns Doing Good: Witnessing Joy and Engagement Firsthand\n\nNouns, through the Nouns Capture app, have already begun to sprinkle the magic of joy and wonder into the lives of young explorers around the world. Our MVP has not just been a theoretical success; it’s been a playground where children’s faces light up with delight and curiosity as they engage in a universe filled with playful Nouns, embarking on adventures that fuse the real and digital worlds.\n\n![Engaged and delighted children navigating the world of Nouns Capture](https://connectedpe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-15-at-11.57.53-am.png)\n\nFrom our hands-on experience, we've witnessed the authentic happiness and excitement that the Nouns Capture app brings to children. It’s not just about discovering and learning; it’s about igniting a passion for exploration and a love for an active, engaging, and joyful form of education, where each Noun becomes a cherished companion in their learning journey. For example students in Singapore using the Nouns capture app as part of a learning activity to learn about Nutrition and Menu planning. (see below)\n\n![enter image description here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FwWw7bpaIAchzny?format=jpg&name=medium)\n\nWe have a profound understanding of this realm and a clear vision of how to craft experiences that resonate with the hearts and minds of students globally. With Nouns at the core, the potential to unleash an even more captivating, enriching, and delightful educational adventures.\n\n\n---\n\n## 🏆 MVP Release and Success\nThe Nouns Capture app has already been released as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) on iOS and has received an overwhelmingly positive response. [Download Here](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/nouns-capture/id6447956444?uo=2)  \n\nSo far, with a word-of-mouth silent launch, we've had 3522 Educational Downloads. This represents schools and educational institutions downloading the app to explore Nouns in their contexts. The MVP showcases the potential of the app as a powerful educational tool, with students across the globe in our beta audience actively engaging with the platform. This early success is a testament to the app's strong foundation, and we aim to build upon this momentum with the proposed expansion.\n\n![enter image description here](https://connectedpe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-15-at-11.57.42-am.png)\n\n---\n\n## 🎮 How the App Works\nThe Nouns Capture app allows anyone to find and collect Nouns hidden within barcodes/QR codes in their real environments. By scanning these barcodes using the app, students unlock the hidden Nouns and can store them in their digital journal.  \n\nAs they progress through the game and collect more Nouns, students are also presented with opportunities to learn about Web 3 concepts. The app encourages exploration and learning in an engaging and interactive way, helping students gain a deeper understanding of the Nouns ecosystem and the broader principles of Web 3 technology.\n\n![enter image description here](https://connectedpe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-15-at-11.57.48-am.png)\n\nWith absolutely no setup required, you can get started hunting Nouns and playing the base experience right now. Here I am finding Nouns in my local supermarket using the MVP version. \n\n![enter image description here](https://connectedpe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ezgif.com-optimize-1.gif)\n\n\n---\n\n## 📈 Expansion Plan\n### 🤖 Android Development\nAs part of our expansion, we will develop an Android version of the Nouns Capture app to ensure maximum reach and accessibility. This will significantly increase the app's user base and allow students with Android devices to enjoy the same engaging educational experience as their iOS counterparts.\n\n### 🎨 UI Refinement: Unveiling a Nounish Aesthetic\nWhile our current app serves as a functional MVP with essential UI and UX features, it's merely a stepping stone to what we envision. We're excited to bring to life an elevated user interface that embodies a distinct Nounish aesthetic, complete with harmonious colors and fonts. This refined design aims to not only enhance user engagement but also to resonate deeply with our target audience.\n\n## 🌐 Evolving Playgrounds: Incorporating SubDAOs in the Nouns Capture Universe\n\nIn the next iteration of Nouns Capture, we plan to integrate various SubDAOs, making the experience more dynamic and engaging. Users will have the option to toggle between capturing different elements like Nouns, lil nouns, or gnars.\n\nThis inclusion allows for a broader, more diverse gameplay, offering a richer user experience while encouraging creativity and exploration. By doing this, we aim to unlock new possibilities and continuously evolve the game to meet and exceed user expectations.\n\n![Example of toggling between capturing various elements in the Nouns Capture app](https://connectedpe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-21-at-2.56.05-pm-e1697860665424.png)\n\nOur inclusive approach aims to nurture a symbiotic relationship with SubDAOs, allowing them to infuse the game with their distinctive flavors, creatures, and narratives. This organic amalgamation aims to perpetuate an ever-evolving, rich, and engaging user experience, encouraging continuous exploration, learning, and fun.\n\n\n\n### 🏋️ Global Launch to 20,000 PE Teachers\nLaunching the Nouns Capture app is far from a ‘build it and they will come’ approach. We are not starting from scratch; instead, we are leveraging an established stronghold in a crucial educational niche.\n\n-   **Pre-established Audience:** We proudly host a robust audience, ready and waiting. Their presence guarantees that the app will not fall on deaf ears but will be eagerly embraced and incorporated into diverse learning environments.\n    \n-   **Teacher’s Influence:** Our network consists of 20,000 teachers, each a conduit of creativity and influence. Their involvement means tailored experiences crafted with expertise, ensuring the app's utility and engagement are maximized.\n    \n-   **Quantifying the Impact:** Let’s decipher the numbers - imagine each teacher on our list works with 100 students (its probably more than this), we are looking at a potential ripple effect of impact that helps proliferate nouns. \n    \n-   **Innovation and Authority:** Our reputation precedes us. With a history of delivering value, the Nouns Capture app is another innovative offering that the educational community will trust and adopt enthusiastically into their learning programs. \n    \nThis isn’t a hopeful venture into uncertainty. It is a strategic deployment of an innovative tool into a welcoming and prepared ecosystem, promising not just exposure, but meaningful engagement and expansive influence.\n\n### 📚 Integration with School Curricula\nOur audience of teachers appreciates turnkey solutions that provide immediate value in their classrooms. To make this possible, we develop world-class, curriculum-aligned lesson plans that can be easily implemented. Our goal is to seamlessly integrate the Nouns Capture app into school curricula worldwide. By incorporating the app into students' learning, we ensure they gain valuable knowledge about key Web 3 concepts and other core subject areas while engaging with the Nouns ecosystem in a fun and interactive manner.

[Move It](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/move-it/kopilngnmfklhhjocdfdlokmodibcbmk): A brain break Chrome extension for students with 98 million pageviews.\n 2. [Balance It](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/balance-it-task-cards/id630956844): An interactive mobile app for teaching gymnastics and balance skills, with over 1 million downloads.\n 3. [Sports Tracker](https://sportstrackerapp.com/): A school sports software with over 330,000 student accounts.  \n\nThese achievements demonstrate our dedication to creating and delivering high-quality experiences that resonate with students and educators worldwide, as well as our capacity to effectively reach & shape these audiences.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Nouns ROI: Benefits to the Nouns DAO\n### 🌍 Real-Life Proliferation of Nouns\nThe Nouns Capture app offers a unique opportunity to expand the Nouns brand's reach among the global school student body, targeting a vast and diverse audience. By launching the app to our network of 20,000 PE teachers, we will introduce thousands of students to the Nouns ecosystem. While many proposals focus on Web 3 users, we believe that true proliferation stems from making Nouns known in traditional contexts. Schools serve as an ideal avenue for genuine proliferation, as they bridge the gap between the digital world and everyday life, providing an immersive and educational experience for students to learn about and engage with the Nouns ecosystem.\n\n### 🤝 Engage the Next Generation\nThe World Economic Forum estimates that over 1 billion people will be using blockchain-based systems by 2030, and much of this future audience is currently in today's schools. By introducing Nouns and Web 3 to students early on, we can help cultivate a knowledgeable user base familiar with the Nouns ecosystem and contribute to the broader Web 3 community. We plan to do this via in-app education and interactive experiences.\n\n![enter image description here](https://connectedpe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-15-at-11.58.09-am.png)\n\n---\n\n## 🎤 Nouns Capture at NFT Conferences and Events\nNouns Capture will be a valuable tool that can be leveraged at NFT conferences and events as an innovative and engaging way to educate attendees about Nouns and Lil Nouns. By utilizing Nouns Capture in these situations, we aim to create memorable experiences for participants and generate enthusiasm for the Nouns ecosystem.  \nHere's a simple scenario illustrating how Nouns Capture can be effectively utilized at NFT conferences and events:  \n- Attendees are informed about the Nouns Capture activity during the event's opening announcements or through promotional materials distributed before the event.\n- They are instructed to download the Nouns Capture app on their smartphones to participate in the activity.\n- The event organizers have strategically placed Nouns hidden within QR codes throughout the venue. These QR codes could be located at various points of interest, such as exhibits, booths, or food and beverage stations.\n- Attendees use the Nouns Capture app to scan and collect the hidden Nouns as they explore the venue and engage with the event's programming.\n- As they collect Nouns, participants also learn about Web 3 concepts and the Nouns ecosystem, further enhancing their understanding and connection to the Nouns brand.\n- Upon completion of the activity, attendees return to the Nouns booth to prove their captures by showing their in-app journal containing the collected Nouns.\n- Event organizers reward the participants with prizes, such as exclusive NFTs, merchandise, or event passes, creating a memorable and engaging experience for attendees.\n\n---\n\n## 💰 Budget Breakdown\nUI Refinement and Android Development (Nouns Capture): $15,000\nMarketing and Global Launch: $10,000\nCurriculum Integration and Content Development: $5,000\nOperations: $5,000 USDC\nTotal: 35,000 USDC\n\n---\n\n## 🗓️ Project Timeline: 4-Month Roadmap to Success\n### 📅 Months 1-2\n- 🎨 UI Refinement and Android Development for Nouns Capture\n### 📅 Months 3-4\n- 🎯 Finalize App Features and Integrations\n- 📚 Start Curriculum Integration and Content Development\n- 🚀 Begin Marketing and Global Launch preparations\n- 📚 Complete Curriculum Integration and Content Development\n- 🚀 Finalize Marketing and Global Launch preparations\n- 🌐 Nouns Capture App Global Launch\n- 🛠️ Operations commence\n\n---\n\n## 🔧 Ongoing Support and Maintenance\nCreating and maintaining impactful educational experiences for students worldwide is at the heart of our business.

No physical keys needed.\n- **Explore** the spaces to discover and interact with the Nouns universe.\n- **Buy** nounish furniture, items or NFTs directly at the villa, with your Ethereum wallet.\n\nRevenue generated from bookings and sales of nounish items will be partly channeled back into the Nouns treasury, as well as shared with partnering communities and Nouns owners.\n\n**Timeline**\n\nWe plan to complete all work in 12 to 24 weeks and start welcoming guests by 2024.\n\n**Team**\n\n- **Management**: Led by the villa owner, an experienced property developer.\n- **Development**: Carried out by dlabs, known for working on projects like Nouns Agora, Optimism, Slice and Juicebox.\n- **Design and art**: Made by skilled architects, designers and artists.\n- **Community**: Nouns owners and communities will be able to partner up with us and become sponsors of the project, further customising the spaces at the villa.\n\n**Funding request**\n\nWe request 121 ETH to give the villa a nounish makeover, cover operational expenses for 1 year, as well as ensure guests have a highly curated experience.\n\nThe villa in its present state is already a sought-after location in the area. Renovating it will only add to its popularity, so execution risks are minimal.\n\nThe primary goal of this project is to explore the potential of a nounish vacation destination, gauging both demand and impact, while keeping risks and costs low for the DAO.\n\nThe villa will stay Nouns-themed for at least 2 years, and possibly indefinitely. This fact together with the growth potential and the future plans outlined below further help justifying the expense.\n\n**Future plans**\n\nThe proposal aims to fund the redesign of the villa and cover operational costs, but our commitment doesn’t stop there. In the coming months we’ll explore the following areas, either autonomously or with further support from the DAO:\n\n- **Nounish home goods**: In collaboration with artists and designers, we’ll craft a line of items and furniture inspired by Nouns. They'll first appear at Villa Nouns and then will be available for everyone to buy, helping to proliferate the Nouns vibe far and wide.\n- **Activities for everyone**: We’ll offer a range of activities to enhance the guest experience further. Think pools, sports areas, dining spots, and curated outdoor adventures for kids and adults.\n- **Builders retreats**: During the low-season we plan to host artists, hackers, and creators to brainstorm and build on nounish ideas, free of charge. Leveraging Prop House for the selection process, Villa Nouns will be temporarily turned into a hub sparking innovative projects and fostering connections in the Nouns ecosystem.\n- **More spaces, more stories**: We plan to open more properties locally and around the world, especially in places rich in art and culture. It’s not just about expanding — it's about building a global community that shares the Nouns spirit.\n- **Franchise model as a public good**: Keeping in line with the CC0 spirit, we’ll be opening doors for property owners to become part of Villa Nouns, while ensuring quality through a rigorous review by our team.\n- **Decentralized ownership**: If the concept proves successful and Nouns DAO wishes to double down on the initiative, it will be possible for the DAO to own or co-own the estate.\n\n![3D Render](https://i.postimg.cc/wvz0Smvj/2-final.jpg)\n\n---\n\n## The nounish experience\n\n![Villa_Nouns_Gate.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/m2Zxzzn0/Villa-Nouns-Gate.jpg)\n\nReferences to many past and future Nouns projects will be integrated with the interiors of the villa and the surrounding natural environment. \n\nGuests will be able to read the Nouns comic, ride Gnars skateboards or surfboards, watch the Nouns movie, learn the history of Nouns, and more. Furthermore, holders of Nouns and derivatives will enjoy an even more personalised experience, customising screens and interiors of the villa based on their NFT holdings.\n\nCertain areas of the house like the bedrooms will be themed on specific Nouns or derivative collections. The overall experience will also evolve over time due to feedback and new projects in the Nouns ecosystem.\n\nMost items at the villa will be Nouns themed, like towels, cutlery and home accessories, and some will also be gifted to guests. Among the nounish objects, furniture and decorations, we also plan to build suggestive stone mosaics and murals made by artists in the Nouns community. \n\n![_final.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/TPDBMryW/final.gif)\n\n**Booking and entering the villa**\n\n![main.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/cHc90Td6/main.jpg)\n\nGuests will be able to book the villa on Airbnb, or directly onchain through a custom booking website on [villanouns.wtf](http://villanouns.wtf).\n\nThe villa can be accessed by connecting the wallet on-site and verifying the purchase. Other wallets can also be appointed by the buyer to unlock the villa using delegate.cash.\n\n![iphone mock.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/BntdNW4p/iphone-mock.jpg)\n\n---\n\n## The villa and location\n\n![1.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/VLh7fJP9/1.jpg)\n\nVilla Nouns is an elegant villa located in Sardinia offering stunning views over the La Maddalena Archipelago, one of Italy's most coveted tourist destinations.\n\nThe spacious interior is designed for relaxation and focus, while the outdoor patio and large private garden are perfect for enjoying al fresco dining, relaxing in the Jacuzzi, or immersing in nature.\n\n![2.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/fy280LtN/2.jpg)\n\nThe villa includes a large living room with a sofa bed, four bedrooms (three with queen beds, two of which have en-suite bathrooms, and one with twin beds), and three bathrooms with hydromassage showers.\n\nFeatures a 1250 sqm garden, a heated four-person Jacuzzi, high-speed Starlink internet connection, heating and air conditioning, and private parking for up to two cars.\n\n![Villa_Nouns_Backyard.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/T2JM3qtV/Villa-Nouns-Backyard.jpg)\n\n**The location**\n\n![locations.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/htH3rfC4/locations.jpg)\n\nThe villa is located in the heart of Costa Smeralda between the picturesque port town Palau and the popular spot Roccia dell’Orso. Its prime location provides easy access to beautiful beaches and renowned attractions.\n\nThe spectacular Maddalena islands, are just a short boat ride away, while the prestigious Porto Cervo and Porto Rotondo are conveniently close, making it the perfect location to enjoy the most evocative places Sardinia has to offer.\n\nSee more on [villanouns.wtf/gallery](http://villanouns.wtf/gallery)\n\n**Financial aspects**\n\nThe villa has been rented out for several years, with rates between $50 and $110 per person per night based on the season. This generated on average $60k of revenues a year, mainly during summer.\n\nBy renovating the villa we expect an increase in demand and in turn revenues and prices — especially during summer. During the low season, the villa may also be repurposed for events and host other activities related to Nouns, allowing experimentation in coordination with the DAO and the exploration of alternative revenue models.\n\n---\n\n## Roadmap\n\n**October 2023 - December 2023**\n- Villa Nouns refurbishment and redesign\n- Development of website and on-chain booking experience\n\n**From January 2024**\n- Open bookings at [villanouns.wtf](http://villanouns.wtf) and start welcoming guests\n\n---\n\n## Funding request\n\n![expenses.png](https://i.postimg.cc/mZCsxQGw/Screenshot-2023-10-20-at-20-09-58.png)\n\n**Villa redesign and refurbishment - 71 ETH**\n\n- [Renovation] Allocate 45 ETH to upgrade the villa's interior and exterior to incorporate Nouns-themed objects, decorations, furniture, NFT displays, and other technologies to make the guests experience unique.\n- [Professional services] Architects, interior designers and artists involved in the redesign process\n- [Onchain lock and interactive experience] Make a smart lock which allows access based on onchain bookings, as well as develop and fine-tune the interactive experience at the villa.\n\n**Development - 28 ETH**\n\n- [Website and contracts integration] Build the [villanouns.wtf](http://villanouns.wtf) platform, with an innovative onchain booking experience.\n\n**Marketing and operational costs - 22 ETH**\n\n- Create material to promote Villa Nouns as the ultimate nounish destination, such as drone and showcase videos, and professional photo shoots.\n- All operational and management costs involved in bringing Villa Nouns to fruition.\n\n**Total ask: 121 ETH**\n\n---\n\nPS.

Decked out in noggles, experiencing Nouns stories, interacting with vibrant Nouns sculptures and characters, and immersing themselves in a world where disability, disadvantage, or illness doesn't define them. Instead, they're celebrated for their individuality and spirit, all while being introduced to the imaginative universe of Nouns. This is the magic of the Variety Kids Xmas Party, and with your support, we can make it an unforgettable experience.*\n### Introduction:\nThe Variety Kids Xmas Party is an annual event held in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia that brings joy and inclusion to over 5,000 Victorian children facing diverse challenges. We seek Nouns DAO's support of 28.99 ETH to enhance this iconic event, held across 39,000 square metres, with the Nouns bringing the FUN and ENTERTAINMENT, ensuring a memorable experience for all attendees including:\n* 5,000 kids in need\n* 3,000 parents and carers\n* 600 corporate volunteers\n* 100 VIP guests\n\nThis year's party will be held in mid-December 2023.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SybKqjyga.jpg)\n\n### ⌐◧-◧ Background:\nFor over three decades, the Variety Kids Xmas Party has been a beacon of hope for kids in need. Held at the Melbourne Convention Exhibition Centre, this event has touched the lives of over 165,000 children since its inception in 1986. The massive event is completely FREE for 5,000 children and 3,000 carers to attend, ensuring that each child receives a gift and experiences an inclusive day of fun, activities, stage entertainment, carnival rides, all-abilities sport and an all-important visit from Santa. For many, this celebration is the only one they have during the Christmas season, and the gifts they receive at the party are often the only ones they receive. The Variety Kids Xmas Party is a safe space for children living with disabilities or experiencing disadvantage or illness, allowing them to be themselves without fear of judgment from their peers. This remarkable event is made possible by the dedication and hard work of the small Variety team and over 600 volunteers.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkJSDa1xp.jpg)\n\n\n### ⌐◧-◧ Profound Impact:\nThe Variety Kids Xmas Party is more than just a day of fun; it&#39;s a lifeline for families who often feel isolated or overlooked. For many children, the event offers a rare opportunity to experience joy, laughter, and a sense of belonging. Parents often remark on the transformative effect of the party, noting the boost in their children's confidence and self-esteem. The ripple effect extends beyond the children to their families, providing them with a much-needed respite and the chance to see their children thrive in a supportive environment. The memories created during the party serve as a source of strength and inspiration for families throughout the year.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkJ5cjkxT.jpg)\n\n### ⌐◧-◧ Testimonials:\n\"You have no idea what this means to us. Without Variety, we were having no Christmas.\" Kayla\n\n“Being on your own and battling to afford the basics, you are so conscious of trying to make Christmas special. I will be forever thankful that Variety did that for me and my boys this Christmas.” Shelly, parent of Jaxon and Dylan.\n\nTo make the day even more special, each child receives a gift bag full of age-appropriate toys and games (including Nounish items) to take home and enjoy. For some children, this was the only gift they received that Christmas.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryvQ5jklT.jpg)\n\n\n### ⌐◧-◧ Videos and imagery:\n\nWatch the party in action – news coverage of last year's event \n[7 News Click here to play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8bpybGRlZY&themeRefresh=1)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H17HSTyea.png)\n\n[9 News Click here to play ](https://youtu.be/GXfgo3frPww)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJx9B6yxa.png)\n\nMeet some of the families who attend and hear what it means to them \n[Click here to watch Seth & Teagan's Variety Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhk80WxPSyk)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1gBLaJea.png)\n\n**Click here to view our gallery** of [pictures of the day](https://photos.app.goo.gl/GATPZpPnU5TEy7nTA) \n\n\n### ⌐◧-◧ A Nounish Christmas Deliverables:\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1AOkl6x6.png)\n\n\nTo elevate the 2023 Variety Kids Xmas Party, we propose the Nouns brand activations in synchronicity with the Variety red branding where Nouns bring the FUN and ENTERTAINMENT!

On average, previous Xmas Parties have cost USD $160,000 and have been funded from Variety's non-profit funds.\n\nVariety is committed to continue to fund this event with the knowledge that it is crucial for thousands of families whose children are living with disabilities, illnesses, or experiencing disadvantages. It serves as a day of joy and inclusion, often providing the only Christmas celebration and gifts these children receive. For over three decades, this event has been sustained by year-round contributions from our dedicated individual of donors and fundraisers.\n\nThe current cost-of-living crisis has intensified the needs of our most vulnerable families, increasing the demand for our support. Simultaneously, community donations have become less frequent, as they are no longer as possible for some individuals as they once were.\n\nIf the Nouns prop passes to fund the 2023 event, the money previously allocated for it will be redirected to our individual grant program, which provides essential items like wheelchairs, communication devices, scholarships, education programs and assistance dogs for kids experiencing disadvantage or living with conditions including Cerebral Palsy, Down Syndrome, Autism, global development delay, muscular dystrophy, brain\ninjury, spinal injury, rare and chronic disease and more.\n\nVariety – the Children’s Charity requests a total of ~USDC 47,479 (28.99 ETH) to fund the Nouns brand fun and entertainment zones. Variety will be contributing ~USDC 113,000 to cover the balance of event costs.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryuBcikxp.jpg)\n\n\n**BUDGET**\n\n* Entertainment – all on-stage performers, Santa, dancers, character performers such as the Grinch and Real Dinosaurs, carnival rides including a ferris wheel, sideshow alley, Santa’s grotto, all-abilities sports activations, silent movie cinema, and main stage visual, LED screens, audio, staging, stage lighting & rigging  **$32,511 USD/19.85 ETH**\n* Photography/filming and package creation **$3,219 USD/1.97 ETH**\n* Nouns Noggles - donated **$0 USD/0 ETH**\n* LEGO - donated **$0 USD/0 ETH**\n* Colouring sheets - printing **$645 USD/0.39 ETH**\n* Free standing foam Noggles sculpture **$645 USD/0.39 ETH**\n* Nouns signage x 25 **$804 USD/0.49 ETH**\n* Nouns character costume **$4,506 USD/2.75 ETH**\n* 600 Nouns branded tees worn by corporate volunteers across the venue **$3,862 USD/2.36 ETH**\n* 2,000 temporary Noggles tattoos **$1,287 USD/0.79 ETH**\n\n **TOTAL  **$47,479** USD  /  **28.99** ETH**\n\n*** USD to ETH conversion correct at time of writing 19 September 2023 3.00pm AEST\n\nIn addition, Variety will be paying USD $128k (funded across the year by our donors) as follows\n* Catering extras (90% catering sponsor)\t$7,443\n* Event management and non-main stage venue AV, staging & rigging\t$31,900\n* Venue hire cost\t$15,400\n* Gift bag of toys for every child\t$64,169\n* Transport, freight, couriers and postage \t$2,951\n* Staffing, logistics, and marketing\t$6,416\n\t\n    \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1L_0i1x6.jpg)\n\n\n### ⌐◧-◧ The Team\n**Georgie Smith - Variety Project Lead**\n[Georgie](https://https://twitter.com/RoxbySmith) has a twenty-five-year career in not-for-profit fundraising, marketing and event management and currently leads Variety – the Children’s Charity digital innovation program including crypto philanthropy.

          "description": "# Real World Nouns Asset Purchase\n\n\n**PLEASE NOTE, THIS PROPOSAL WAS UPDATED FOLLOWING A COMMENT AROUND ADDING MORE LEGAL CLARITY TO THE PROCESS + EXPLAIN HOW NON-KYCd MEMBERS CAN SELL THEIR OWNERSHIP RIGHTS**\n\nNounsDAO is among one of the most prominent communities and ecosystems in web3. For the last couple years, Nouns has led the charge on a new way for projects and ideas to get funded. Over this time, the vast majority of funding was issued with few strings attached or promise of financial returns - instead, focusing on funding things the community wants to see happen in the world. \n\nThis proposal is an experiment to break ground on a new kind of proposal: one that has the potential to provide perks to Nouns holders, and that has the potential to generate financial returns on deployed capital to ultimately increase demand for Nouns NFTs. \n\n**Some background on Venture Club**\n\nVenture Club is a web2.5 project that has been building legal infrastructure to democratize capital formation over the last 1.5 years. Our core focus is on taking offchain assets (such as equity, SAFEs, SAFTs, Income sharing agreements, real estate, etc), and moving them compliantly onchain as NFTs, in different UIs. The NFTs created are DeFi compatible between KYCd addresses and allow-listed smart contracts. \n\nYou can see some of the assets we’ve minted onchain [here](https://opensea.io/collection/venture-club).\n\nOur proposal is a proof of concept, to demonstrate the ability of Nouns DAOs to participate in the purchase of traditional real world assets. We believe this option will open up new use cases for NounsDAOs, which have not yet been possible before.\n\n**Why should you care?**\n\nHaving a clear and tested process to acquire “real world” assets has the potential to benefit current and future Nouns members. The main reasons why this should be of interest are:\n\n1. Provide perks to members. For example, a piece of real estate could be purchased, and access could be given to Nouns members. Or rental income could be shared with Nouns members. Having access to these sort of assets most definitely helps propagate the Nouns meme, while simultaneously providing a very tangible benefit. \n2. Provide Nouns holders a means to benefit financially from teams and startups they support via the DAO.\n\n**A Proof of Concept**\n\nThis proposal is a proof of concept (POC), to demonstrate that 1. NounsDAO can deploy capital to purchase an offchain asset; and that 2. ownership of this offchain asset can be claimed compliantly by its NounsDAO members. *This POC aims to demonstrate this concept via the purchase of an ownership stake in Venture Club, who has built the technology to make these offchain purchases possible.*\n\nOur hope is that this model can be used in the future by NounsDAO to invest and acquire a variety of new asset classes which has not been possible until now (to our knowledge, a few projects have tried, but none have been able to provide a clear / compliant path forward). \n\nBy proving this model out, it may even be possible that we see an increased demand for Nouns NFTs from speculators looking for exposure to assets and opportunities only available to this community. \n\nThe end result is a NounsDAO with **an increased number of options** in front of it. Options to engage, options to reward, options to monetize and attract - in order to create a more desirable community to be a part of. \n\n**Our proposal**\n\n- We are asking the NounsDAO community to make a strategic 50 ETH investment in Venture Club (via a SAFE investment agreement).\n- Ownership in the investment will be split between all Nouns members who claim their personal ownership in the SAFE via the Venture Club app.\n- Payment for proportional ownership in the SAFE will be made in a fresh ERC20 token that will be airdropped to all Nouns holders. This is a utility token, used as payment only.\n- As a US based company focused on tokenization of securities, Venture Club takes compliance seriously. Only KYCd individuals will be able to claim ownership in the SAFE. In addition, unaccredited US investors will not be able to participate. \n- For individuals who don’t meet these criteria, they will be able to sell their ERC20 payment token for their portion of the SAFE using P2P tools like airswap. Venture Club will help facilitate this process via our Discord.\n- As part of the Venture Club tokenization process, it is possible to set carry fee (currently 1%), as well as royalty fees (currently 5%) on secondary sales of NFTs. In order to incentivize the sponsoring of this proposal, fees arising from this proposal will be shared equally between Venture Club and those who sponsor this proposal.\n\n**Milestones and next steps / sequence of events**\n\n- Once this proposal is approved, a deal page will be published on Venture Club\n- A Discord channel will be created in the Venture Club Discord to provide any support\n- Nouns holders will be able to access the opportunity on our app, and mint their respective share of the SAFE contract via an NFT\n- Once this proof of concept is complete, we would like to work with other teams looking to provide tangible benefits to Nouns holders.\n- We will timebox the duration to 2 months after the proposal passing to claim ownership rights.\n\n**Some additional information**\n\n- Some of our investors: [Gabby](https://twitter.com/gabusch) (Founder of YGG), [Timour](https://twitter.com/timourxyz) (Seed Club), [MetaCartel Ventures](https://metacartel.xyz/) (first venture dao in web3), Evgeny (founder of [Re7](https://www.re7.capital/)), Ben Middleton (founding partner at [Ascensive Assets](https://ascensiveassets.com/)), [Cultur3 Capital](https://cultur3.capital/) (web3 focused fund), among others\n- Our [slide deck](https://cloudfiles.to/yw9rM7pi48O) (pw:Seed23)\n- Our app: [app.ventureclub.club](http://app.ventureclub.club) (note, we’ve created a group for Nouns which you can join on the Network tab.

Approximately 35% budget reduction by changing manufacturing approach, reducing marketing and team budget.\n- Primarily manufacturing a Keycap set with an optional full keyboard. Also separating MK DAO and Physical NFT experiments for the next iteration.\n- Simplified overall plan, shortened text, better FAQ, and detailed costing spreadsheet linked below.\n\n[**Positive feedback from the previous proposal**](https://www.nounsagora.com/proposals/266):\n- Community Alignment: A shared belief that the mechanical keyboard and Nouns communities have synergies, both being passionate and vibrant.\n- Artistic Value: Recognition that mechanical keyboards are not just tools but are viewed as curated works of art by enthusiasts.\n- Detailed Proposal: Depth and informativeness of the proposal including the visual concepts. Also, confidence in the team's ability given their experiences.\n\n---\n---\n\n### TL;DR:\n- Nouns-themed keycap set by a top-tier designer (not just glasses seen in the illustration) to introduce Nouns to an enthusiastic subculture of gamers, developers, collectors, and typists.\n- 75K for Approx. 700 keycap sets or 275 full keyboards (keycap set + case), or a combination between those two limits. With 3 tiers of Artisan keycaps for marketing and low entry points.\n- The grant covers all of the costs and Nouners mint for free. Profit from non-Noun holders goes to the project treasury until they can afford to buy a Noun and participate in governance.\n\n### Intro\nAs one of the primary means of interacting with our online world, keyboards are more than just a tool – they've become a piece of personal expression. Let's design a keyboard a Nouns-themed Mechanical Keyboard (MK) that the community appreciates! NextMech and I are excited to bring this project to Nouns in collaboration with top-tier keyboard designers. With our internal MK knowledge and technical ability we plan to introduce the MK community to Nouns.\n\n### Overview\nOver the years, [an online subculture (reflected in partial MK ecosystem stats)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W-Io9Y8zjAwppzKt9UkSLhiGImyQgc8J9M1UUUvh6o/edit?usp=sharing) has evolved, valuing custom keyboards as art pieces. This MK enthusiast community operates similarly to NFT communities. For instance, designers unveil their plans to collectors, who pre-order to finance manufacturing costs. The communities, decentralized across various platforms and websites, foster a rich dialogue between designers and fans. [They even organize global meetups](https://twitter.com/search?q=%22mechanical%20keyboard%20meet%22&src=typed_query). There's potential to gradually unify these communities to enhance the experiences.\n\n![mk_reddit](https://github.com/profishional/nmk_files/blob/main/meetup.png?raw=true)\n\n[SF meet March 5th, 2023 with photoshopped Nouns mk - [original photo](https://twitter.com/villi/status/1632132746029182977)]\n\nThe community activity and other meetups can be seen by searching for [\"mechanical keyboard meet\"](https://twitter.com/search?q=%22mechanical%20keyboard%20meet%22&src=typed_query) on Twitter/X or searching \"[custom keyboard](https://www.instagram.com/explore/search/keyword/?q=custom%20keyboards)” on Instagram.

We thought about MK NFTs in different forms such as generative art with manufacturable traits, DAOs as Vendors for group buys, hardware-embedded signatures, etc., to help improve the ecosystem. But at the beginning of the year, we learned about Nouns and saw the potential for consumer-good NFTs. So we thought it would be interesting to run this experiment with the most vibrant NFT community.\n\nWe devised a proposal in April ([prop #266](https://nouns.wtf/vote/266)) with an ambitious plan. We listened to the feedback and created this revision. However, due to the uncertainty surrounding the fork, we delayed the initiative to observe the outcome and find a better time for our own schedules.\n\n### Nouns x MKs\nThe proliferation can take immediate effect with current channels. For instance, the Nouns Esports team can incorporate keycaps into their gaming setup (without affecting functionality), showcasing to the gaming spectators. Nouns keycaps may serve as POAPs for crypto conference and hackathon participants, while the full Nouns keyboards are taken to global meetups. Furthermore, images of these keyboards and keycaps will appear on popular online forums and social media accounts of MK enthusiasts - the design is not going to be as blatant as the one you see, but rather more aesthetic and nuanced in appearance. Also, we plan to work with MK builders and reviewers who have hundreds of thousands, even millions of followers to showcase the MK and tell the Nouns DAO story.\n\n### **Summary Plan**\nHere is a simple cost breakdown. A more detailed breakdown is below:\n* 75K to manufacture approximately 700 keycap sets, OR a maximum of 275 full keyboards OR some combination of the two depending on demand, while still meeting Minimum Order Quantity.\n* 15K for assembling, packaging, storage, and decent-quality shipping.\n* 29K for digital marketing and artisan keycap including low, medium, and high tiers.\n* 35K for the team, MK designer, website, and fulfillment.\n\n## **Total - 154K USD**\n\n----\n\n## FAQs\n- **What will the design be?** NOT THE ONE YOU SEE. That is just to spark the imagination, the designer will come up with something much more aesthetic and subtle once we go through the brief.\n- **Who is the designer?** They are one of the mentioned people below. Due to their high profile status in the MK community, they don't want to reveal their name until they see the support from Nouns and can begin working on it. I can assure you he is one of the best out there for this project.\n- **Who is going to buy this?** Ideally NOT people in crypto. The point isn’t to sell it to Nouns holders, it's to distribute it to the MK community and proliferate the idea. That's also why we are working with a designer that the MK community respects.\n- **How much are the NFTs?** Approximately $120-130 USD for the keycap set and $350-380 USD for the full keyboard option. Noun holders can purchase for free (within the budgeted units in the grant) while non-Noun holders will pay full price. We aim to distribute these on popular vendor platforms to maximize reach!\n- **How does the redemption work?** Once you redeem, the NFT becomes non-transferable. Because sharing pictures of the keyboard is important and having an NFT is even better.\n- **How are you going to sell to noncrypto people?** We aim to work with traditional distribution channels such as marketplaces and communities to reach the MK community. We are exploring solutions for wallet creation for the consumer at the purchase stage.\n- **Why is it so expensive?** Custom mechanical keyboards by top-tier designers, with good quality switches, cases, and components can go around $500 USD. Given the interested designer and other components, this is a reasonable price.\n- **How many units?** The free units for Noun holders would be Approximately 700 keycaps or 275 full keyboards or a combination that totals a maximum of 75k worth of manufacturing. We plan to sell more units for a profit to non-Nouns holders.\n- **Will the keyboards be assembled?** We have an assembled and un-assembled option for the minters since for some collectors assembling is part of the custom MK experience.\n- **How long does it take to deliver?** Design could be done quickly but we want to give the designer 4-6 weeks. Manufacturing takes about 6-7 months. Delivery should take 2-4 weeks. So about 8 months, but assuming unforeseen challenges we are accounting for 9-10 months from the time funds have been received.\n- **What happens to the grant and mint profits?** The grant helps meet the Minimum Order Quantity for manufacturing which wouldn’t be possible otherwise. The profits from the non-Nouns holders go to the team which we expect to be less than 20K USD.\n- **Will anything be returned to the Nouns DAO?** Because we are MK enthusiasts we simply want this to become a reality, so we have made the team portion of the grant very modest relative to the work it takes. But we are committed to using some of the profits to buy a Noun and participate in the community - this also incentivized Nouns to help the success of the project. We don’t think it’s Nounish to be underpaid, make direct payments to the DAO, and leave.\n- **How big is the MK community?** The forums and discord servers of designers are similar to or, bigger in size and activity compared to crypto communities. It is pretty scattered online, but I have made a [spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W-Io9Y8zjAwppzKt9UkSLhiGImyQgc8J9M1UUUvh6o/edit?usp=sharing) to provide some context.\n- **How will the project continue besides a one-off product?** We will plan an extension if this grant proves to be successful. It would involve creating a subDAO and experimenting with various products.\n\n## Detailed Plan\nCustom keyboard manufacturing involves two main components: the case and the keycap set. Switches and other components are also significant, but they are less customizable; therefore, we will simply use ones considered enthusiast grade. For a more detailed overview of mechanical keyboards, [check out this intro made by NextMech](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gRH83pF1RBXW6Eve_OLC9Fb7hAlxQQEP/view?usp=sharing).\n\n**Design -** To start, we will incorporate the Nouns brand into the keyboard canvas. We have talked to several designers who can create an aesthetic Noun-themed keyboard. These include [BIIP](https://instagram.com/biipmk), [NoPunIn10Did](https://nopunin10did.com/kat-napoleonic/), [sourmk](https://www.instagram.com/sourmk), pikku-allu, dededecline who would be able to capture the essence of the Nouns in a design. Also, a design by a top artist plays a major role in introducing Nouns to the MK community, ensuring a high-quality product that enthusiasts will enjoy. Here are some examples by the mentioned designers:\n\n![biip_dots](https://github.com/profishional/nmk_files/blob/main/biip_dots.png?raw=true)\n[BIIP Dots]\n\n![Untitled](https://github.com/profishional/nmk_files/blob/main/mk_1.png?raw=true)\n[Pikku Allu Symbiote]\n\n![Untitled](https://github.com/profishional/nmk_files/blob/main/mk_2.png?raw=true)\n[Sourmk Dandy]\n\n**Manufacturing -** We will work with a manufacturer with double-shot ABS capability to be able to make high-quality keycaps. However, if the creative direction requires a custom font we may trade off double-shot quality for printing flexibility. As for the case, we will be using an available unit from existing manufacturer catalogs that matches the keycaps set. The remaining components will be wholesale units that are considered enthusiast-grade quality. \n\n**The NFT -** will include the custom design once the prototypes are finalized. Mint of keycaps will be priced at approximately $120-130 USD, while the full keyboard (including the keycaps) will be $350-380 USD. It will have boolean-based redemption on [nouns.mk](https://nouns.mk/) since we don't want to burn the NFT and instead share it online. We also aim to work with traditional distributors to be able to reach the MK community.\n\n**Marketing -** Prior to, and during the minting of the Keyboard NFTs, we will launch digital and physical marketing efforts to increase the visibility of the project. The physical marketing is in the style of MK communities. We are considering 3 different types of artisan keycaps. The keycaps are, Resin filled 3D keycaps that could have Nouns characters or traits inside, high-quality metallic keycaps, and Plastic keycaps with Nouns related graphics that can be given away for free at crypto conferences and MK events, or for a low cost online.\n\nHere are examples of existing Resin and metallic keycaps by artisans. They will be designed and produced in a Nouns related theme. These caps can be a great addition to the custom keyboard, or they allow MK enthusiasts to add it to their existing keyboards.\n\n![resin_caps](https://github.com/profishional/nmk_files/blob/main/resin_cap.png?raw=true)\n![metal_caps](https://github.com/profishional/nmk_files/blob/main/metal_cal.jpeg?raw=true)\n\n**Delivery -** Once manufacturing, assembly, and quality tests are complete, the NFTs can be redeemed. They will be stored with a distributor or manufacturer and can be redeemed at any time. It is possible to sell the NFTs prior to redeeming them with a 5% royalty fee.\n\n### **Current Progress**\nWe will keep up-to-date information and progress on our Notions page. Here are some highlights from the current progress:\n- Determined feasible manufacturers for case and keycaps.\n- Discussing terms with keycap set designer and singular keycap manufacturers.\n- Registered [Nouns.mk](http://nouns.mk/) domain, Twitter/X [@nounsmk](https://twitter.com/nounsmk), ENS [nounsmk.eth](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth%3A0x144975eEc9674fd0Af3d6F3FBa8D660879cE3881), and nounsmkdao.eth for marketing.\n- Updated budget and design constraints from previous proposal attempts.\n\n## **Team**\n**[Profish](https://twitter.com/profishcrypto)**: My past experience is creating wallets and automation a crypto trading companies and cadCAD tokenomics.

          "description": "# Build-A-Noun Droposal\n\n# Build-A-Noun\n\nDrop an open edition of Nouns traits & Build-A-Noun system using [ERC6551](https://tokenbound.org/) and TBAs, based on [Station](https://www.station.express/)’s [Loot2](http://l00t.world). \n\nTeam: [Michael](https://twitter.com/0xmcg) - contracts + front-end - built [l00t.world](http://l00t.world) [[GH](https://github.com/mcgingras)], and [Martin](https://twitter.com/anquetil) - front-end - built [mogu.wtf](https://www.mogu.wtf/), [updates.wtf](https://www.updates.wtf/) [[GH](https://github.com/anquetil)]\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/D1x8Vvp/Mint.png)\n\n\n## WHY\nNouns has minted and encouraged Open Edition [Droposals](http://nouns.wtf/vote/346) to generate revenue for the DAO and open access to Nouns media to a broader audience. We should expand this to the core  Nouns artwork with an experimental open edition that allows fans and Nouns-curious folks to build their own Noun. This could be a fun Droposal event that onboards many new Nouns players via a fun, experimental, yet meaningful, open edition. If there's interest, it could unlock a new primitive within Nouns.\n\n## HOW\nAnyone can mint a Character on an infinite open edition. A character (an NFT) holds Traits (also NFTs) - noggles, heads, etc… They can then equip those traits and the character will reflect them visually onchain.\n\nThe distribution of the NFT traits will happen via a 3-day open edition on a standalone site, where users can mint every trait, and build their Noun. Then, supply will end and those NFTs will be accessible on secondary only.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/xJ7Qg16/Editor.png)\n\n## TECH\nEverything will be deployed on Base for low gas fees. The DAO will be the owner of the contracts and will be able to easily add new traits to the registry via Droposals. If there is any centralization needed, we will come back to the DAO to make decisions.\n\nCharacter / Noun NFT ([Loot2 Example](https://basescan.org/token/0xadbc7ec633b78dc4407215d56eb0861dd7c51431)) holds the NFTs, is mintable forever so that anyone can join. Trait NFTs ([Loot2 Example](https://basescan.org/token/0xb7d488da393b4f34813dabeb295931a2b86ea505#code)) will all be sold in a 3-day open edition, where users can pick which traits to mint, as many of each as they want. New traits can be added to the contracts via DAO Proposals (community submissions or noundry creations for example).\n\n## DETAILS\nWe aim to have the project completed by the end of November. The mint fee will be similar to Zora's - 0.001 ETH, or ~$1. If this can reach a large audience like past Droposals, this could bring significant revenue to the DAO. For reference, This is Nouns minted 3,500 editions at 0.05 ETH, or 175 ETH total.\n\nCompensation:\n-   3 ETH to [Station](https://www.station.express/) for contract work\n-   5% of mint fees each for Michael and Martin (based on Agora’s [Droposals fee](https://nouns.wtf/vote/346)) via 0xSplits.",

Check out our playable demo here (use Safari for MacOS users):\n[NounsTown Demo](https://thepixelshop.itch.io/nounstown-demo)\n\n\n# PROLIFERATION\nOur proposal aims to proliferate Nouns by focusing on a ***specific target market of the PC gaming community*** that is interested in indie games, specifically ***the rogue-lite genre***.  A rogue-lite indie game provides a compelling opportunity for Nouns to enter the gaming sector due to the following reasons:\n\n##### Rising Popularity\n- Indie developers have had incredible success in recent years due to their ability to design ***innovating*** and ***creative*** new games that AAA studios often avoid\n- Developers have gained access to multiple ***mass distribution platforms*** such as Steam, Nintendo Switch, Itch.io, and Epic Games to reach a wide audience\n- Available resources and advancements in game development have provided a landscape for small teams, or even individual developers, to produce games with a ***powerful cultural impact and longevity***\n\n##### Lower Risk Entry to Gaming\n- We conceptualized the game design to ensure as much value and ***replay-ability*** while maintaining a ***reasonable scope*** of work and ***longer-term scalability***\n- Our proposal provides for a ***phased funding and development approach*** to ensure a ***transparent production*** process, opportunities to receive ***community feedback***, and provide multiple ***tiers of content***\n- We will use ***Steam as our distribution platform*** to launch the game; however, we will explore porting the game to Nintendo Switch after the initial launch and financial considerations\n\n##### The Charm of Pixel Art\n- Our art team collectively has over ***30 years of pixel art experience*** and will design a game aesthetic that will resonate with indie gamers and pixel art enthusiasts\n- Pixel art games have had tremendous success with nearly ***13,000 games available on Steam.***  Some household names including Stardew Valley, Shovel Knight, Celeste, Terraria, Hyper Light Drifter, Enter the Gungeon, Octopath Traveler, and Baba is You\n- Our game will showcase many different pixel art styles including our ***modern aesthetic gameplay, retro style UI and game map, and high resolution portraits***\n\n##### Creative Commons\n- All of the ***art and animations*** that we produce during development will be ***open-source*** and available to the community to use!\n- ***After development***, we will ***consider making the game open-source*** to collaborate with game developers and artists to contribute new content\n\n# GAME OVERVIEW\n##### Game Engine\nThe game will be developed using ***Godot 4***, a free and open-source game development engine!  \n\n##### Genre\n**Rogue-Lite**\nThe key feature of a Rogue-Lite genre is a game loop that results in ***permadeath***.  Each time a player begins their attempt or run, they will either defeat the final boss or die trying.  A Rogue-Lite game generally involves some ***permanent progression*** that takes place ***outside of the run***; usually in the form of upgraded weapons, statistics, abilities, or skill trees.\n\n**Bullet Hell**\nBullet Hell combat mechanics emphasize ***complex bullet patterns*** for the player to navigate and dodge.  Our bullet hell game will be designed as a twin stick shooter where the player is on a ***flat plane with a top-down perspective***.  They will then use one joystick to control the player and the other joystick to control the direction of shooting, or for the real ones, mouse for shooting and keyboard for movement!\n\n**Non-Linear Progression**\nOne of the unique selling points of our Rogue-Lite game is that it will have Non-Linear progression.  The two main features to highlight in this design include a ***unique map that is generated each run*** and the freedom for the player to ***decide their order of progression***.    Each location will have distinct characteristics that the Player may take advantage of depending on their weapon selection and upgrade composition.  \n\n**Inspiration**\n[Enter the Gungeon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/311690/Enter_the_Gungeon/), [Hades](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/), [Risk of Rain 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/632360/Risk_of_Rain_2/), [Nuclear Throne](https://store.steampowered.com/app/242680/Nuclear_Throne/), [Vampire Survivors](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/)\n\n\n##### Story\nWelcome to the world of ***Nouns Town***, a charming community nestled amidst pixelesque landscapes.  The citizens of **********Nouns Town********** are visionaries that seek to build a spectacular new world as seen through a new type of lens, ***Noggles**!*  These Noggles may look like quirky little glasses, but they empower the wearer to harness the boundless energy within themselves.\n\nBut an ominous cloud is forming over Nouns Town.  The malignant ***Lich King*** has arrived with an ***army of shadowy minions*** to seize these *Noggles* and exploit their power to build their own evil empire.  Nouns Town desperately needs a hero to put an end to the invasion!\n\n##### Primary Game Mode: One Noun, Every Day, Forever\n- Play as a new Nouns character every rolling 24-hour period beginning with Noun #1 and all Nouns that follow\n- Every player will attempt the daily run with the same weapon, world map, upgrade choices, and enemy spawns\n- The map seed will change each day along with the playable character\n- Compete against all other players on the leaderboard for the fastest clear time\n- All daily winners will secure their place in the game’s history!\n\n![A Noun A Day Promo](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2Febdf3ba8-dbc9-460f-8931-857889572ea5%2Fstage_nouns_v_souls.png?table=block&id=cbaa22ac-9c9d-4d42-856c-64c595492dde&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Traditional Game Mode: Protonoun\n**Play as the Protonoun in a traditional rogue-lite game mode**\n- Select your starting weapon and begin your run in a unique generative map\n- Gain Upgrades as you progress through each room of enemies\n- Search for two hidden keys to unlock each stage Boss\n- Encounter NPCs and Events as you explore the map\n- Complete achievements during your run to unlock new content\n- Defeat the final boss, the Lich King, to beat the game\n\n![The Protocave](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2F91f59fde-3358-41dc-8a8a-14f1721c4141%2Fprotocave.png?table=block&id=dd19d7a6-e01a-4bd6-86b1-838af593bf3d&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Weapons\n\nThe player will begin each run by selecting a single weapon type.  As they progress through the game, their weapon gets upgraded to powerful new tiers.  New weapons are unlocked through an achievements system and provide diverse play styles and synergies, for example:\n\n- Sniper Rifles - Slow fire rate and reload rate, but high single target damage\n- Shotguns - high close range damage, but wide bullet spread at long range\n- Rocket and Grenade Launchers - significant area of effect damage, but slow reload speed and fire rate\n- Assault rifles - higher ammo capacity and fire rate, but less damage per bullet\n\n**Sample** **Weapons:**\n![Weapon Concepts](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2F457fa7a0-a1a4-4ec4-ad5d-b0887aa853cb%2Fweapons.png?table=block&id=f4229042-9adf-4a99-9c0c-83b4fcdde425&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Upgrades\nAs the player clears each room,  they are rewarded a pair of Noggles to return to their rightful owner and gain a new weapon modifier.  Each upgrade is inspired by various characters from the Nouns collection.  Early concepts include:\n\n- Lightning Bolt Noun unlocks chain lightning\n- Basketball Noun unlocks bouncing bullets\n- Popsicle Noun unlocks frost bullets\n- Pencil Noun unlocks piercing bullets\n- Chipboard Noun unlocks spark aura\n- Baseball Noun unlocks curving bullets\n\nPlayer upgrades each have multiple tiers of strength.  Further, different combinations of upgrades will create fun synergies and provide a unique gameplay experience each run.  Unique and innovative upgrades will be explored during game development.\n\n![Upgrade Card Previews](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2Feef9abba-1288-4e3d-9be3-02216f525651%2Fnouns_upgrades_promo.png?table=block&id=d9a79c15-bee4-42f8-ae7e-5b1a53e0d826&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Minions and Bosses\n\nMinions and Bosses will be based on the Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult: Forgotten Souls collection.  All minions will be designed to have a diverse range of attack styles and bullet patterns.  Early attack style concepts include melee, burst range, sniper range, summoners, and complex bullet patterns for elite minions.  \n\nWe will use rare NFTs from the Forgotten Souls collection as our Stage Bosses and the Lich King as our final boss.  Our first Boss engagement will be designed and implemented in Phase I of production.\n\n**Sample** **Minion Designs:**\n![Minion Concepts](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2Fed2d7a9a-3f76-484b-9c3b-a8bef7f00f4a%2Fminions.png?table=block&id=c90faec9-9a19-40dc-9b9a-aeab46b202ab&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Map and Room Design\n\nWith the game’s setting taking place in Nouns Town, our protagonist will progress through the map to clear each location of the Forgotten Souls.  As mentioned in the Genre section above, our map and game loop will have a ***Non-Linear*** design.  The design will have the following characteristics:\n\n**Unique Generative Maps**\n\n- Each run will generate a new Nouns Town map seed with approximately 30 - 45 Locations, 2 Stage Boss chambers, and 1 Final Boss chamber\n- The Player will have the freedom to decide which locations to clear first\n\n**NPC and Event Rooms**\n\n- We will include friendly NPCs and locations to provide healing, potential upgrades, and/or narrative progression\n- Additionally, we are exploring various Event Rooms that occur random times throughout each run that provide new challenges for the player\n\n**Room Architecture**\n\n- We will design a large library of Locations and Rooms that the map generator will pull from to maintain a unique and diverse world for each play through\n- Room types within each location will have consistent thematic designs to provide new challenges and allow the player to associate location aesthetics to gameplay characteristics\n\n**Room Decorations**\n\n- We will produce a library of tile sets, decorations, barriers, and destructible objects to fill each room with a fun and unique personality inspired by Nouns\n- We will mix and match each room’s architecture to various aesthetics to give each room a unique personality and provide diversity between each run\n\n**Sample assets:**\n![Tile Set Preview](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2F440c398d-3d22-4e10-93c7-1ed447b2e1ca%2Ftileset_sample.png?table=block&id=7419a6e2-cfd2-4208-9a47-5d3715964af5&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Sound Design\n\nFull sound design will include sound effects and an original soundtrack.  We aim to capture a combination of playful comic-like sound effects paired with a sound track inspired by hip-hop and funk instrumentals.  We are in discussion with a number of experienced sound designers that are interested in joining the team later in development.\n\n# PRODUCTION STATUS\n\n##### Pre-Production Complete - Phase 0: Design, Prototype, and Art Style\n\nOur team began production in July 2023 and have established the game design document, art and animation style, game framework and systems, and our initial prototype.

It adapts to the evolving narrative of community-led efforts within Nouns DAO, offering a dynamic platform for Noun holders to personalize their governance journey.\n\n### Why Atenea?\n\n#### Atenea is more than a governance client—it's a canvas for Nouners to craft their governance masterpiece. It's about turning governance from a duty into an experience. **Shape your governance. Shape your world. Make it Nounish.**\n\n### Our Journey for the Past 4 Months\n\nSome months ago, navigating on-chain proposals seemed complex. We saw each DAO member needing a unique solution due to the decentralized and varied nature of our system. So, we aimed for a solution offering freedom—a system to explore governance without limits. With a clear vision, we began to color our sketch.\n\n- #### **Fun and Creativity**:  We built a widget system for customization. Like a canvas to an artist, Atenea aims to spark curiosity in Nouns governance.\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/DmjZzRy.gif)\n- #### **Agility**: We designed all elements to be flexible and self-adjustable, aiming for a smooth user experience.\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/YNy0RUK.gif)\n- ####  **Informative**: We created a database to include all necessary information for a Nouner, avoiding the loss of crucial data. Atenea, named after a Greek goddess symbolizing wisdom, reflects our mission for an informed community.\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/KRNkiR2.gif)\n- #### **Useful and Analytical**: Atenea aims to provide insights from social to economic aspects within DAO, all easily accessible, valuing Nouners' time while enhancing their experience.\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/orIQS8t.gif)\n----\n\n## Current Widgets from Atenea\n\n\nWe have spent most of our time building the structure of the Atenea, live saving, sharable clients, remix clients, accounts, etc. Even so, we have created 15 widgets with which you can explore governance starting today:\n\n- **Proposal Overview**\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/i6lO4D9.gif)\n- **Active Proposals**\n![Imgur](https://imgur.com/NvHMR5v.gif)\n- **Proposals Funded by Category**\n![Imgur](https://imgur.com/AakYkyH.gif)\n- **Executed Proposals**\n![Imgur](https://imgur.com/D4sVVrt.gif)\n- **Noun of the day**\n![Imgur](https://imgur.com/6duG6XM.gif)\n- **Nouners Feedback**\n![Imgur](https://imgur.com/MZmLHRh.gif)\n- **Roadmap**\n![Imgur](https://imgur.com/RKW4g8v.gif)\n- **Stats**\n![Imgur](https://imgur.com/UVMBY1s.gif)\n- **Funded Teams**\n![Imgur](https://imgur.com/f8rgbLu.gif)\n- **Proposal Team**\n![Imgur](https://imgur.com/WMSgEI6.gif)\n- **Treasury**\n![Imgur](https://imgur.com/UocWFlT.gif)\n\n\t   \n\n### What Makes Atenea Unique?\n\nThe 'network effect' within Nouns is special—it’s about many joining forces for something larger. We envisioned an open system where any coder could create widgets, with imagination being the only limit. This collective effort will birth something unique.\n\nAtenea removes the entry barriers to client development to make Nouns governance more exciting. Choose which part of the governance you want to improve and, we will make it as easy as possible for you.\n\n### ROADMAP \n\n#### **High-Priority**\n\nRoll out features like bidding, making proposals, candidate functions, assimilating updates.wtf, and proposal voting.\n\n- Integration of external data sources, such as updates.wtf, would require the development of API connectors or data import tools. This ensures that Atenea keeps up to date with information from these data sources. (We have already completed it)\n\n- Implementing interaction with smart contracts would involve creating and designing the user experience (UX) for interacting with them, with a strong focus on maximum security.\n\n- The proposal creation system is currently our top priority. It allows users to create proposals directly from Atenea, including all necessary data such as category, budget, roadmap or team, all accessible through Atenea widgets. In addition, all the information in these proposals would be accessible through the API for anyone to use.\n\n#### **Mid-Priority**\n\n- Optimize data processing and improve the open-source widget creation system.\n\n- Atenea will only make sense if it works in public, so articles (for propdates) will be made announcing the progress (2 times a month) and a monthly video talking about the most important aspects in which progress has been made in the period.\n\n----\n\n## TEAM\n\n### Josep: Product, UI and Community.\n\nI'm a senior student majoring in mathematics and business with a strong passion for product development.

          "description": "# Spec The 🔥 To Eliminate The Put (Requesting Feedback) \n\nI am proposing parameters to the current proposed implementation of [The Burn](https://w.mirror.xyz/AmHOzH-FQZVO3IhGXHSvCRxRSf2MO6VCZdmMwNEIyKE). I am putting this up to raise awareness among voters, stimulate the conversation, and listen to feedback. \n\nI will break this down into two sections: a TL;DR for people with a technical background, and a further breakdown to help the general community understand the issue at hand - why I believe the current proposed burn mechanism specs do not eliminate the intrinsic value arbitrage opportunity, and most importantly what can be done to resolve this! \n\n**TL;DR: I am proposing to change the timeframe that ‘burns’ could potentially occur from 90 days to a fork threshold period of N days.** There are 69 Nouns in Fork 1 - this would bring new circulating supply down to 332 - meaning if all new auction bids are from RFV traders it would take 33 days to trigger a new fork (assuming zero are sold on secondary market below BV). If we keep the proposed 90 days there could be potentially 3+ more rounds of forks before a burn is executed. \n\n**I am proposing that we change from auction average value to the lowest settlement price within the previous N days (which I am calling fork threshold period).** In order to completely remove the intrinsic value arbitrage opportunity we have to set it to zero. This is done by having the lowest auction price within the previous N days set as the new strike price. If the lowest auction price is above book value then default to book value (as BV would be the redemption value if forked & RQ). These parameters would ensure protection for the DAO when auction prices trend below BV. \n\n**I am proposing that we do not build this design into the protocol and first test with a manual solution I have described below.** I believe that once we eliminate the intrinsic value arbitrage opportunity completely, this will no longer be an issue to plague the DAO, therefore there is no need to make protocol changes which are time and cost intensive. \n\n—-----------------------------\n\n**Issue At Hand:** Currently we are faced with an issue that Nouns BV (book value) is higher than the current market demand, therefore creating an intrinsic value arbitrage opportunity to bid in the auction below BV, then Fork & RQ (Rage Quit) a pro rata share of the treasury and capturing a RFV (risk free value) trade. There have been numerous solutions proposed on how to resolve this issue such as burning excess eth, ‘forced spending’, vesting newly minted nouns etc. The issue is, the current proposed solutions do not eliminate the intrinsic value arbitrage opportunity or generate organic market demand for auctions to trade above book value. \n\nBelow I have created a simulation of a Fork Threshold Period that I have set to 40 days, this means it would take 40 days of auctions to mint enough new Nouns to trigger a fork. This includes mock data of potential auction prices and prop spending following current trends of auction prices below book value. \n\n![Simulation 1](https://imageupload.io/ib/fIL1gNXfHG5LwWx_1697353217.png)\n\n\nFirst we will review this simulation with the current proposed burn structure:\n\n![Current Burn Specs](https://imageupload.io/ib/DvM0rTXmI9JzdIt_1697265039.png)\n\nWith this current proposed burn structure we would have to quickly spend or burn 500.58 eth.\n\n**Why This Solution Does Not Eliminate The Arb Opportunity:** We are using an average vs the lowest auction price, therefore there is incentive for the RFV traders to keep the auction average below BV with a large spread. After fork 0 we saw auction prices range from 16-33. Therefore if we assume in the above simulation that the people who bought below are RFV traders, there would be an additional 720.36eth leaving the treasury in the next fork - of which 51.18eth is RFV (Risk Free Value). At this rate we would still be losing eth to arbitrage trades, and between the ‘burn’ & fork we would see 1220.94 eth leaving the treasury. Rinse and repeat every fork threshold until we have organic market demand where all auction prices are consistently above BV. \n\n—-----------------------------\n\nNext we will review a simulation of my proposed parameters which involves taking the lowest auction price within the last N days (fork threshold). Please note, the first simulation is going to be the most extreme, after this though the arb opportunity is completely closed. This means the actions moving forward of burn, spend or dilute would be much less volatile. \n \n![Proposed Burn Specs](https://imageupload.io/ib/vjRAATPpIQ7smrh_1697265038.png)\n\nFrom this data you can see that we would be taking the lowest auction price of the last N days (fork threshold period) which becomes the new book value price. Ending BV is 32.47 and we would need to reduce this to match the lowest auction price of 25.7…. There are three options on how we can do this: Burn. Spend. Dilute. \n\nBurning will be done via sending eth to: 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD spend would send money to Prop House to be used for future funding of props and builders (as an example), dilute would be done by releasing Nouns into a rewards wallet - still controlled by the DAO, but out of the treasury therefore counted towards circulating supply. \n\nFrom the example above the options for this simulation would be to Burn 2945.28 eth, Spend 2945.28 eth by sending it to Prop House for future use, or Dilute by releasing 120 Nouns to a rewards wallet for future distribution. \n\n**What Can Be Done To Resolve This:** I do not believe any of these choices should be made as a default decision built into the protocol. I believe the community should be presented the data from each fork threshold period and be allowed to make an informed decision on which option they would prefer to execute. The eth can be transferred to an escrow contract so it is out of the treasury and not calculated towards BV while the DAO votes to Burn. Spend. Dilute - If dilution is the option voted on by the DAO, the escrowed eth will be returned to the Treasury after Treasury Nouns are transferred to the rewards wallet. This decision should be executed within N days (I propose 7 as that aligns with the current proposal voting period). \n\nI am proposing to create a dashboard that will display the following stats and will also serve as a sentiment voting platform for Nouns token holders: \n\n![Voting Dashboard](https://imageupload.io/ib/LHQ2bhseBWmVvpI_1697314351.png)\n\nDuring the fork threshold period based on the data provided DAO members can come to vote on which option they would like to choose: Burn. Spend. Dilute. This vote will be done via snapshot and at the end of the fork threshold the results will display the vote, and a community member can put an onchain proposal to execute the collective decision. I believe this will increase governance participation - allow community members to feel they have a say in which option is being chosen, and also allow for decision making based on accurate information vs estimations. \n\nAs I mentioned above the first simulation will be the most extreme and volatile. Here is a simulation where auction prices have a tighter window as we trend towards our goal of auction prices = or > BV. \n\n![Simulation 2](https://imageupload.io/ib/kPDDkkqQUKVa70R_1697353393.png)\n\nFor simulation 2 with my proposed specs we have an ending BV of 15.84 and the lowest auction price of 15.42. This means we would be presented with the options of burning 350.85 eth, spending 350.85 eth or releasing 30 Nouns into the rewards wallet. \n\n![Proposed Burn Specs](https://imageupload.io/ib/9yylEzvvYRaXKcv_1697314351.png)\n\nAs you can see this is less volatile of a situation vs simulation 1. Once the RFV traders know that there is no longer an intrinsic arb opportunity we should see Nouns find its true market value, and only people bidding and buying into the project who have an aligned vision. \n\nAuction prices are unknown and game-able if the arb opportunity is still open. This means that even if the idea of the DAO was to spend down the treasury quickly, there would not be accurate data available to make decisions quick enough (as the final numbers are not calculated ‘until it's too late’). Meaning we will not know the true number to burn, spend or dilute until the final days of the 90 day period, and we currently have a 7 day voting period for proposals to pass or fail. If the RFV traders see large props in the pipeline they will adjust their auction bids based on that information. This will result in a constant cat and mouse game until we generate organic market demand for the auction above book value. \n\n**Disadvantages To Closing Arb Opportunity:** While I personally believe this is the most effective solution to resolve our current issue, I do recognize that there are disadvantages to closing the arb opportunity completely which include the following: \n- **Market Discovery of True Book Value** - This means that we would be faced with volatility during the price discovery phase, are we prepared to see a 12-15 eth Noun during these current market conditions?\n- **Decreased Auction Participation** - Currently ~85% of auction bids are from RFV traders, if the arb opportunity is closed we may see a decrease in auction activity until we generate more organic market demand\n- **Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Arb Opportunity** - The issue we are currently dealing with involves the intrinsic arb opportunity….. If we remove this we will see traders with more advanced financial strategies come into play, which would involve an extrinsic arb opportunity when auction prices = or > BV (there is a resolution to this issue which can be proposed as a phase 2 as the intrinsic arb is taken care of first)\n\nI have ran other simulations with different auction price & prop spending scenarios and can share with anyone interested.

Nouns are culture!\n\nWe are harnessing the power of every tool possible in memes, gaming, stories and pop culture to co-create a shared identity with the many believers and hard workers of the DAO.\n\n10 months ago, NounsLATAM began uploading 3D animations to YouTube **daily**, aiming to create the most Nounish YouTube channel out there. \n\nDaily 3D animations are an excellent public good because they are freely accessible to the public. Creating these high-quality daily animations breaks down barriers between Web2 and Web3. Continuity and everyday visibility through YouTube legitimizes and spotlights Nouns beyond crypto Twitter, playing a key role in making Nouns a globally recognized and beloved brand. \n\n **OUR IMPACT IN 2023**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wIrvheC.jpg)\n\n⌐◨-◨  20+ MILLION VIEWS\n⌐◨-◨  [300+ Daily Animated Videos (in 3D!)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4MBWgNEwIAxi0Dbkbb1KDfP1c2qMfzOF)\n⌐◨-◨  100,000+ Hours of watch time\n⌐◨-◨  30,000+ Subscribers\n⌐◨-◨  5900+ Comments\n⌐◨-◨  800,000+ Views from Youtube Remixes\n\n**⌐◨-◨  20+ MILLION VIEWS**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pGzV1yz.jpg)\n*NounsLATAM's animated video content has gone viral, with our top three videos racking up over 15 million views combined.*\n\n\n**[⌐◨-◨  300+ Daily Animated Videos (in 3D!)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4MBWgNEwIAxi0Dbkbb1KDfP1c2qMfzOF)**\nAs a **two-person** video editor and graphic designer team with over 22 years of combined experience, we have consistently created these Nouns-themed animated 3D videos for the past 10 months, working **exclusively (and full time)** on this proposal. \n![](https://i.imgur.com/aTKTfU6.jpg)\n*Check out our process for making our daily animated 3D videos!*\n\n\n**⌐◨-◨  100,000+ Hours of watch time**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3asUcSP.jpg)\n*100,000 hours of organic watch time, from people who really love our daily animated Nouns memes and stories, all in 3D!*\n ![](https://i.imgur.com/e72R4ZQ.png)\n\n\n**⌐◨-◨  30,000+ Subscribers**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hbDQOqu.png)\n*We began with zero subscribers and are about to cross 40,000.

This means that in the future, if we want to turn the GIFs into collectible NFTs, we will be able to do so.\n\nEvery GIF will be shared with the Nouns Twitter account manager for distribution to the community.\n\nAll 100 GIFs and files will be stored in a folder accessible to the community at any time.\n\n------------\n\n# Description\n\nI would like to share the proposal I have been working on, as I believe it could greatly benefit the proliferation of our beloved **Nouns**, something we all cherish in this community.\n\nThe proposal I have in mind is **simple** yet **powerful**: I want to create a large number of **2D** and **3D** gifs and stickers featuring Nouns characters. These gifs and stickers will be communicative, humorous and **relatable** with the aim of reaching a wider audience with Nouns characters and encouraging their recurring use.\n\n## Goal\n\nThe goal is to make GIFs that people both inside and outside the world of nouns can use. This way, they'll start incorporating nouns into their **daily lives**. Plus, GIFs are currently one of the most viral forms of content because their primary purpose is to be shared to convey an idea, emotion, or joke.\n\n![alt text](https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExd2kycWx5YWR1MTRyeXdhcmRlMzI0ZGI5Z3k2cG1yZGZiNzY5cjBkYSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/MKr18qpDptEKhk6yWp/giphy.gif)\n\n## Pudgy Penguins\n\nA successful case we can take as a reference is  \"Pudgy Penguins\" Gif collection. With just a few months of gif publications, the Pudgies reached many new people and quickly became popular.\n\n![alt text](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FYhMxqhWQAMKjfm.jpg)\n\n![alt text](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1244/1*_-RtCt584lViXV8EureZ_A.png)\n\n![alt text](https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExcHI2Y2liODd3a3cwbjlvcjRxbzZtZzMxem5yOXIzN2d1ZTljOWc5byZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/7Z6pYYjzYNPyPkS6yb/giphy.gif)\n\nAnother important aspect is that producing gifs is more cost-effective than producing videos, and unlike videos, the gifs we create today can be used indefinitely.\n\n## Nounish Gifs\n\nCurrently, the Nounish team is crafting some  cool GIFs for nouns. It's a clever strategy to enhance familiar images by adding the noggles on top of them. However, most regular folks probably don't know what these \"noggles\" are. That's why these GIFs introduce the characters behind the \"noggles\" brand. These will complement the current ones beautifully!\n\nCharacter GIFs are very useful for a brand because users become more attached to the characters and what they represent with each passing day. Currently, neither the community nor individuals outside it have the opportunity to use small nouns to communicate, as the Pudgy Penguins community does. This proposal aims to address that need.\n\n![alt text](https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExNm8wZHk1OHBpYzIxaWJvOWd6ZW53MWd4ZnNiMDBhM2t3Z3ZxbGVkcyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/5DKoUvpIwMLPCMpr1v/giphy.gif)\n\n## Team\n\nTo carry out this proposal, I'll be teaming up with my friend and colleague Santiago Pereyra. He will handle the 2D animations while I will take care of the 3D animations.

Noun's Bidet Revolution!** \n# TLDR\nMakeWater is seeking $34,000 USDC to provide low-income families with Nouns-branded bidets, educate the community on their benefits, and produce high-quality video content showcasing the initiative.\n\n# Summary \n\nWith a $34,000 proposal, MakeWater aims to shift U.S. bathroom culture by promoting bidets, a net positive for the environment and households. Bidets can slash toilet paper costs, boost hygiene, and ease water infrastructure stress. Our pilot will provide Nouns-branded bidets to low-to-middle-income families, complete with DIY installation videos. \nThe initiative involves an educational drive where students, acting as citizen scientists, gather and share data on bidet usage and delve into water issues in their region. This hands-on approach also includes field trips to local water facilities, providing them with a comprehensive understanding of bidet advantages. By partnering with water utilities and local governments, we envision a self-sustaining model, continually championing bidet use. \nAs this initiative grabs headlines, Nouns will stand out as the pioneering force behind it. Your support will be the kickstart we need!\n\n**Update** We’ve updated the proposal after listening to feedback and reduced the initial ask, explained our goal for a self-sustained program (no future nouns funding required), and highlighted how Nouns will be seen as the hero catalyzing this revolutionary change in bathroom culture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# How will it work?\n[![Screen Shot 2023-09-20 at 10.20.35 AM|690x388](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/lilnouns/original/1X/64fdc44ca71b4895023689cf724500b0b393e1b8.jpeg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr56zofQX2o)\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr56zofQX2o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr56zofQX2o)\n\nOur  journey will start with our pilot program in South Texas which will be a pivotal step for data collection, refining strategies, and pinpointing best practices. We are delighted to have already gained the enthusiastic support and active engagement of local utilities and educators,  who will propel the growth of our community and our vision.\nThrough our ongoing community-building efforts, we will strive to gather a strong initial group of participants in South Texas, our pilot region. Far from being just beneficiaries, these participants will become pioneers, actively contributing to data collection and shaping a communal narrative through social media engagement. These authentic stories, personal experiences and testimonials,  will initiate a cultural shift towards bidet use and create a united front against water wastage.\nThe Nouns DAO can kickstart this effort, providing the initial push needed to get the ball rolling. But this isn't just a one-time splash; it's a tide of transformation! The real heart of this initiative is its ability to keep going on its own. Our goal is more than just handing out affordable bidets; it's about making a lasting change in how people use bathrooms in America.\nThis initiative will be a wave of change that keeps building and reaching farther. Our pilot program marks the first splash, but together, we have the power to reshape perspectives, enhance water sustainability, and fundamentally revolutionize water habits across the United States.\n\n**Want a Limited Edition Golden Nouns Bidet ⌐◨-◨?** \nDonate 0.05 ETH or more at  [https://app.endaoment.org/orgs/81-1369592](https://app.endaoment.org/orgs/81-1369592).\nAll contributions further our mission, and as a token of our appreciation, you'll receive the exclusive bidet.\n\n\n# Why Bidets?\nEnter the humble toilet-mounted bidet — a nifty contraption that adds a touch of luxury to your bathroom routine. It replaces or fits beneath the toilet seat and uses a a nozzle to spray water for cleansing. Its installation is easy and doesn't demand a plumbing professional. Many models even showcase features like adjustable pressure, temperature control, and self-cleaning. Beyond all that, however, lies an ecological marvel— a cost-effective solution that promotes better hygiene while reducing toilet paper waste.\n\nBidets have garnered worldwide recognition for their remarkable water-saving abilities and paper-reducing magic. Embracing bidets translates to preserving trees, conserving water, and reducing the energy dedicated to manufacturing and transporting toilet paper.\n\nTheir appeal isn't just environmental; it's also rooted in hygiene. Bidets offer hands-free, pristine cleanliness, an invaluable health advantage, especially in a time when global health awareness is at its peak.\n\nOur aging water infrastructure poses yet another challenge. Sewage systems of many cities groan under the weight of non-degradable items. These infrastructures were designed for a different era, and non-degradable products like wet wipes weren't part of the plan. Despite their convenience, wipes don't break down in water like toilet paper does. This leads to stubborn blockages, damages to equipment, and ultimately, significant repair costs that households and communities have to bear.\n\nBidets, however, offer a sustainable lifeboat. By adopting bidets, we curtail clogs and damages, sparing households and cities from hefty repair costs. It's not just a bathroom upgrade; it's a blueprint for economic resilience, environmental harmony, and public health.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Our Background\n[![Screen Shot 2023-09-20 at 10.20.35 AM|690x388](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/lilnouns/original/1X/4d1175bec0882ed790ebee5f64ef9998d4ab6125.jpeg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0thwr7QItyE)\n[Video of our Lil Nouns Water Purification Kits built in partnership with the Light House for the Blind Nonprofit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0thwr7QItyE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0thwr7QItyE)\n![79685689a8627fcb69f5c7a138529474869a119a_2_1034x748|690x499](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/lilnouns/optimized/1X/79685689a8627fcb69f5c7a138529474869a119a_2_1034x748.jpeg)\nLil Nouns Kits at our Black Girls Code Event in Houston. \n\n![|217x384](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/S_Kp1aNv2LHDB43Vd7I0bRW3nyPCIiP2lVjTWbgxXiDGTn70Y_I0Se93u0w_tHlnoWD1LzBKB4_w7iqBBz-8_Ogbj9kYiRXvt1rOCAVEyVv9r_UjpoFAu0OBOYZCEgScAS1bb44qldiFXtw4YtwVXWI)\n\n*View MakeWater Endaoment Donation History https://app.endaoment.org/orgs/81-1369592\n* In June 2022, Lil Nouns passed our 3,000 nouns kits for students proposal by a resounding 211 to 4 vote (➡️see [here](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/16)).\n* We teamed up with Lighthouse for the Blind to create these kits, and we marked our partnership with a video (➡️watch it[ here](https://youtu.be/0thwr7QItyE)).\n* Our victory streak continued with a win at the FoodNouns Prop, where our proposal to create video vignette for our water education curriculum (click to watch our video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYrK_6Y_qUU), ➡️and check out our [tweet](https://twitter.com/makewaterorg/status/1659299148066177024?s=20)) garnered unanimous support (➡️see our %100 positive votes in [here](https://www.foodnouns.wtf/vote/3)).\n* We’ve also received a positive response Lil Nouns PropHouse (Open Round 12) for our proposal asking Lil Nouns to be a 3D printer prize sponsor for World Water Day youth competition (➡️see [here](https://prop.house/lil-nouns/round-12-open/3649)).\n* Nounish Team also highlighted our work on World Water Day, with a reel showcasing our work and our ongoing partnership with the community (➡️see [here](https://youtube.com/shorts/4rzK2iCFoWA?feature=share)).\n* Beyond our cherished Nouns community, our network encompasses educators, water utilities, and beyond.

          "description": "# Propdates 2.0\n\n*“What ever happened to Prop #123?”\n“What was the most successful Nouns proposal?”\n“Which proposals should we try to repeat?”\n“Who are our most committed contributors?”*\n\n[Propdates](https://updates.wtf) is here to answer these questions. With contracts built by Wilson, Propdates is the best way to keep up with Nouns proposals after they pass, and an entirely new design space within the greater Nouns ecosystem. We’ve never had any consistent, onchain way to keep track of contributors’ work, and no way to recommend regular updates. Down the line, one could imagine Propdates as an onchain oracle for proposal progress.\n\n## PROGRESS SO FAR\nI built the Propdates site and public graph, inspired by Krel’s [requests.wtf](http://requests.wtf). What started as a weekend experiment has grown into something much bigger: it’s clear that we’ve tapped into something special. In fact, Propdates has already become part of the pre-proposal conversation process - it is expected that a proposer regularly updates the DAO on their work. In just a few weeks, we already have had 17 unique posters, and more coming.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/mt9nCgz/metrics.png)\n![](https://i.ibb.co/CzXyQrg/other.png)\n\n## LOOKING AHEAD\nWe’d like to move Propdates from an experiment to a fully-featured Nouns app and a key part of the ecosystem, on par with teams like Agora, Federation, Prop House. Our end goal is for Propdates to be a protocol any contract or app can plug into to determine a proposal’s success. It is clear that it could expand further than just Nouns.\n\nWe are asking for three months of funding (more on the team below). Martin will be close to full-time, but working on other projects as well (similar to almost all software proposers). We expect Onion to be part time for two months or so. For these months, our priorities will be:\n1.  Contract improvements to expand functionality  & data\n\t- New channels to post updates in: prop house entries, user channels, custom channels\n\t- Revamped admin system / permissions + “Super Admin” to unlock proposals where proposer is unresponsive\n\t- Explore contract to update/revoke streams based on a proposal's updates\n2.  Improved editor, claiming and submitting UX\n\t- Easy image upload via Arweave or IPFS (and potentially expand as a public good for Nouns ecosystem)\n\t- In-app markdown editor and previews for better UX\n3.  Farcaster integration for likes & comments on updates\n4.  Open Editions to celebrate Completed Props\n\nOur goals by January 31st, 2024 are:\n-   150 proposals marked as completed\n-   400 updates posted\n-   30 weekly updates on average\n\nAdditionally, we want to encourage past proposals to share updates on their work, but recognize it’s often hard for contributors to track down their sponsoring proposers (pre-v3). We are requesting 0.05 ETH to send to each of the first 100 successful props (before prop #363) that posts a non-trivial update as an incentive to kickstart the protocol. At the time of writing there have been 225 successful proposals, so this would go a long way to getting all proposals marked as completed.\n\n## TEAM\n\n-   [martin](https://twitter.com/anquetil) worked on [Mogu](http://nouns.wtf/vote/321), [Explorer Grants](http://nouns.wtf/vote/178), [Hack Week](http://nouns.wtf/vote/253)\n-   [onnnnnnnion](https://twitter.com/onnnnnnnion) (solidity) worked on [BLOCKS](https://mint.fun/zora/0x1F781d47cD59257D7AA1Bd7b2fbaB50D57AF8587), [onions renderer](https://twitter.com/onnnnnnnion/status/1639045062595170307), [PH Infinite Round Committee](https://prop.house/infinite/nouns-retro-grants)\n\n## FUNDING\n-   Team: 30 ETH for three months (via Stream)\n-   Incentives: 5 ETH (100 * 0.05 ETH)\n-   OpEx: 2 ETH\n \nWe commit to posting updates on [updates.wtf](https://updates.wtf) bi-weekly to keep the community updated on our progress.

By only allowing aged nouns to fork, we are inviting more long term players to participate in the auction.\n\nSuggested spec:\n* Age will be counted by noun IDs. e.g. if the currently auctioned noun is 876, then noun #700 has age 176 days.\n* The required age for forking will be a parameter configurable by the DAO, zero at first.\n* The functions `escrowToFork` and `joinFork` will check for this requirement.\n\nIf we see significant support for this change we will update this proposal to include funding for an audit of this change.\n\nverbs team ⌐◨-◨\n",

          "description": "# The Giant Noggles: Australia's Next Iconic Tourist Attraction (phase 1)\n\n## **Preface**\n\nLet me just preface this with the fact that I am open to and I welcome any suggestions, feedback, changes and input. I would very much appreciate some if you have a different vision for this. None of this is set in stone per se and will utilise the edit functionality if there needs to be changes.\n\n---\n\n## **Introduction**\n\nThe Allure of the Big Things: Australia, with its vast landscapes and vibrant cities, has a tradition of celebrating the unique, exemplified by the nation's fondness for \"big things.\" With the inception dating back to \"Ploddy\" the dinosaur in the 1960s, these colossal attractions have woven themselves into the country's cultural fabric. \"The Giant Noggles\" aims to be the next in this esteemed lineage, offering an experience that is not just visual, but interactive and deeply engaging.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1gnFeNZ6.png)\n\n---\n\n## **Market Analysis**\n\nAustralia's \"big things\" have always been more than just roadside attractions; they've been symbolic landmarks, driving tourism and community engagement.\n\nAs of this year, there are 150+ \"big things\" scattered across Australia. I personally have visited many of them since a kid, but moreso now with my own young kids... they are absolutely obsessed with the big things.\n`[video proof - will be added once I can track noggles on my kid's face]`\n\nSome of these icons, like the Big Banana in Coffs Harbour, are known to draw hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. The Big Banana, in particular, underwent several expansions over the years due to its popularity, transforming from a mere oversized fruit to a park with rides, tours, and a shopping precinct. It's now reported to be generating revenue of $12 million (AUD) annually.\n\nRevenue for these attractions can vary based on location, accessibility, and amenities. For instance, the Big Merino souvenir shop is reported to have annual sales in the six figure range, even without considering auxiliary revenue streams like cafes or tour services nearby.\n\nThe constant evolution of these attractions, coupled with their undying popularity, signals a thriving market with a penchant for the novel and the nostalgic. I believe The Giant Noggles, with its modern interactive approach, can carve its own niche in this market, attracting both domestic and international tourists. Additionally, it is likely to get nationwide news coverage.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJI_5eEba.png)\n\n---\n\n## **Suitability To The Task**\n\nI have already played a part in manufacturing the largest noggles in the world, which are currently installed at Rusutsu Resort in Hokkaido, Japan. They measure 9x3m and gained the excited attention of the nouniverse and beyond, and will continue to be embedded in the experience of the visitors to Rusutsu for potentially years to come. They will be highly visible during the upcoming Winter while placed in the middle of one of the busiest points in the resort!\n\nEver since we had those installed though, I have been dreaming up how to go bigger! This time around, I would like to retain the full aesthetic with the black and white lenses, while making them much, much bigger. They will likely be created using structural beams to achieve max strength and size. Making them visible from the highway while driving is the dream.\n\nI'm Australian, currently living in Australia and I am close enough to be able to attend potential sites. Plus I understand the culture deeply and have the ability to talk to all parties needed with clarity to organise such an endeavour.\n\n---\n\n## **Location & Accessibility**\n\n### **Prime Visibility**:\nThe target location is along Australia's bustling east coast highway, the M1 between Sydney and Gold Coast to ensure The Giant Noggles become an unmissable landmark. Such strategic positioning not only maximizes visibility to the huge amount of traffic that travles this highway year round, but also facilitates easy access for travelers and tourists. Clear signages will be crucial to guide visitors, making their approach and journey hassle-free. With the right location, it could bode well for getting Tesla superchargers installed on site to help extend their network too.\n\n### **Land Considerations**:\nWhile I haven't secured land or entered into formal discussions, this proposal seeks to facilitate a research phase. This initial phase will help gauge potential costs associated with land acquisition or leasing. A careful analysis will be conducted to determine the best approach, be it a permanent purchase for the attraction's longevity or a lease agreement to test the waters.\n\n### **Local/Rural Community**:\nThe location could be a key element in engaging the local community and empowering them with local IRL jobs as well as knowledge of and access to the nouns ecosystem. There's potential for ecotourism integration as well.\n\n---\n\n## **Preliminary Research Proposal (Phase 1)**:\nThis phase 1 mission aims to lay the foundation by:\n\n1. Scouting potential locations along the east coast highway.\n2. Estimating costs associated with land acquisition or lease.\n3. Gauging infrastructure and development costs for the three levels of the Giant Noggles attraction outlined below.\n\nThis preliminary research ensures a structured and informed approach to the larger vision, helping to anticipate challenges and allocate resources effectively.\n\n---\n\n## **Proposal Funding Levels (Phase 2)**\n\nWith such an extensive concept, there's a lot of ideas and room for growth. I foresee initial planning around the following 3 levels to accommodate the funding commitment/sentiment from the DAO when a full proposal candidate is presented in phase 2. These levels are an initial indication and are subject to change in structure as the research phase progresses. I am totally open to feedback and suggestions too.\n\n### **Level 1: Minimal Viable Product (MVP)**\n- **The Giant Noggles Structure**: A towering, monumental, eye-catching centerpiece that will serve as the primary attraction and memory-maker.\n  \n- **Oversized Noggles Props**: Interactive, freestanding noggles for visitors to enact the playful illusion of wearing them.\n\n- **Automated Vending Machines**: Stocked with exclusive nounish merchandise, from wearables to collectibles. These machines not only offer visitors tangible memories but also support creators and manufacturers in the ecosystem while requiring minimal maintenance.\n\n- **Self-Serve Photo Stations**: Areas furnished with panels featuring face holes, set against vibrant and creative backdrops, supported by permanent stands for phones/cameras for those easy timer shots.\n\n- **Curated Art & Info Displays**: Artistic displays and panels introducing visitors to the nounish aesthetic and noteworthy contributors in the ecosystem.\n\n### **Level 2: Enhanced Experience**\n- **Nounish Museum & Retail Store**: A deeper dive into the nounish world, offering merchandise and a historical look at its evolution.\n  \n- **Food offerings**: Nounish-themed foods, enhancing the immersive experience for visitors.\n  \n- **Regular Contests & Events**: Organized activities to foster community engagement and ensure repeat visits.\n\n- **Domain-Specific Nounish Communities Sections**: Focusing on various sub-communities within the larger nounish culture.\n\n- **Interactive Learning Stations**: Digital screens elaborating on the history and significance of noggles.\n\n- **Signage & Directional Guides**: Embedding nouns into the very fabric of the space for a holistic experience.\n\n### **Level 3: Stretch Goals**\n- **Art Gallery & Arcade**: Spaces dedicated to the visual appreciation of noggles-related art and playful engagement through interactive games.\n\n- **Co-working Spaces & Events Area**: Multi-purpose spaces catering to the diverse needs of visitors, from professionals seeking a work spot to groups wanting event venues.\n\n- **Essential Amenities**: Comprehensive facilities including bathrooms and showers for the convenience of visitors.\n\n- **Climbing Experience Inside Noggles**: An adventurous add-on to make the primary structure itself a point of engagement.\n\n- **Electric Car Charging Station**: A nod to the future with a Tesla Supercharger setup. Tesla provides these as long as your location meets their criteria, so installation is at their discretion.\n\n---\n\n## **Funding & Future**\n\nI am adopting a two-phase approach:\n\n- **Phase 1**: This initial phase focuses on comprehensive planning and research to lay the groundwork for a detailed and accurate candidate proposal in the future.\n\n    I estimate around 50-100 hours will be spent gathering information. It's very likely that I'll need to travel to some locations to meet with land owners, real estate, local councils and businesses across potential locations - around 7-12hrs of driving in some cases.\n\n    With all this in mind, I kindly request 7 ETH to cover costs for phase 1.\n  \n- **Phase 2**: Informed by the findings of Phase 1, this phase presents a detailed financial proposal. It will detail the costs for the MVP and offer insight into the potential expansion costs for the enhanced experience and stretch goals, while also presenting projected revenue streams and models for each.\n\nThis strategy ensures a minimal upfront investment in research, paving the way for a well-informed MVP proposal. By presenting the DAO with clear options and pricing in the next phase, there will be somewhat of a multiple choice on the candidate proposal where I will seek feedback from voters until support is clear and it gains a sponsor. We can all to decide together what the best plan of attack would be with the information at hand.\n\nAs the attraction garners increased attention and popularity, this vision extends beyond the MVP. Subsequent expansions are poised to transform The Giant Noggles from a novel tourist attraction into a lucrative venture. There's room for advertising, retail, workshops, events and even accommodation.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n**The Giant Noggles isn't just a structure; it's a narrative, an experience, a legacy in the making. I invite nouners to be part of this visionary journey, a chance to be etched in Australia's vibrant tourism tapestry.**\n\nThank you for your time and consideration!",

          "description": "# Let's make a short animated film to fund the Protocol Guild\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJuogvxb6.jpg)](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/npgcssj0xy1xyid9utxob/Nouns_Pitch.mov?rlkey=z8cgbr02oza3e6wl1h3scv54z&dl=0)\n\n## TL;DR\n\nLet’s make a ~45s short animated film to celebrate [Protocol Guild's](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) work on Ethereum, release it as a droposal, and donate the proceeds of the mint to fund Ethereum core development. This prop requests $400k USDC to hire [The Line](https://www.thelineanimation.com/), a BAFTA-nominated animation studio to make this short film. \n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Sy9sXPeZa.png)\n\n## Edit note from candidate feedback\n\nThis prop has been updated from its candidate stage to fix a funding request typo. Also want to acknowledge the excellent feedback from Noun 40 and Trent re: shifting the framing of Protocol Guild from glamorous heroes to tireless stewards / maintainers in the co-created universe of Ethereum. We will work that feedback in with The Line and post an updated script via Propdate.\n\n## Why support Protocol Guild? \n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1yDWDxWa.jpg)\n\nNouns love public art and software, and Protocol Guild maintains the most important public software to us: Ethereum. We've demonstrated this in the past to the [tune of 500 ETH](https://www.nounsagora.com/proposals/108). Instead of continuing with direct donation, I'm proposing that we leverage our financial and creative resources to make a film about PG, and release it as a mintable NFT whose proceeds go towards the Guild.\n\nThis is not only great for PG, but also affords us a unique opportunity to use nounish imagery, characters and themes in a piece of media that will widely seen in our prime demographic of humans who love and care for ethereum.\n\nIt's true that \"donating\" via a mintable film is more risky than giving money directly – but I think telling the story of Ethereum and Protocol Guild through the lens of Nouns is something we can uniquely do. Other DAOs like UNI and LIDO may be able to donate more due to their larger treasury – but none have the mission and mandate to fund creative endeavours like we do.\n\nA successful $400k investment in storytelling can have a **broader reach** than our previous 500ETH investment and drive far **more direct positive attention** to Nouns while at the same time providing financial and cultural support to Protocol Guild. And we have evidence this can work, both from our [past](https://www.thisisnouns.wtf/) [successful](https://www.premiere.wtf/) droposals and the [Stand with crypto](https://zora.co/collect/eth:0x9d90669665607f08005cae4a7098143f554c59ef) mint.\n\n## What's the story we're going to tell?\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJuogvxb6.jpg)](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/npgcssj0xy1xyid9utxob/Nouns_Pitch.mov?rlkey=z8cgbr02oza3e6wl1h3scv54z&dl=0)\n\nPlease watch Bjorn, our director, tell you the story, settings, and characters in his voice. We're working with a draft story and visual references, and will be refining it all over time with input from the Nouns community. Our current draft story is something like this:\n\n>This is a story set in a floating port town, which metaphorically represents the Ethereum ecosystem. Everyone is gathered to celebrate the return of the Protocol Guild, a group of adventurers bringing back innovations that will improve the town (metaphorically EIP-4844). The Nouns play host to these adventurers by inviting them to a big feast. We follow a young child who looks up to the Protocol Guild and follows them across their journey around town, in hope of meeting his heroes.\n\nIf you'd like to check out [the draft script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T1Gw8W74_9BR_o6ADetRxnyxza-SPR7lZdof9jTPslg/edit?usp=sharing) yourself!\n\n\n## The world and its characters\nYou should definitely check out Bjorn's video explaining the world in his own words, but check these images for a preview! And feel free to [flip through the reference deck yourself!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NI_MTJSPafHsAi-W37BWFQeDsi-uBFQe/view?usp=sharing)\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJaijgagp.jpg)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJ6jogpl6.jpg)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryTijlpe6.jpg)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkpjolTx6.jpg)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r16ssgpea.jpg)\n\n\n\n## Who's making the film?\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1OnCNL1a.jpg)\n\nWe're working with The Line – a BAFTA-nominated animation studio whose work span across work for major brands and original animation. They've worked extensively with top tier artists and brands like [Gorillaz](https://www.thelineanimation.com/work/gorillaz), [Lil Nas X](https://www.thelineanimation.com/work/lilnasx-star-walkin), and [Marvel Studios](https://www.thelineanimation.com/work/hero-marvel-snap), and [Nickelodeon](https://www.thelineanimation.com/work/nickelodeon-vines). Our director will be Bjorn-Erik Aschim, who's also a studio co-founder.\n\nI reached out to them not only because they worked on a [viral Chobani video about a solarpunk farm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-Ng5ZvrDm4) – which I think visually and emotively embodies the vision the aspiration of Nouns and Ethereum really well, but also because they are one of the best studios in the world, whose work is widely recognized in the creative industry.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H11spyae6.png)\n\n## Funding & milestones\n**Funding**\n\nI'm requesting $400k USDC to fund this short animation. 100% of the amount goes to The Line to fund the development of the film. The funds will be released over 2 milestones: 1/2 upfront, and 1/2 upon completion.\n\nMilestone payment will be held in an escrow multisig whose signers are the Agora team and will be disbursed to The Line upon milestone completion. In the unlikely event that the film cannot be completed, the remainder funds will be returned to the DAO.\n\nThen, trent.eth from Protocol Guild will submit another proposal to the DAO to release the short film as a droposal with 70% of the proceeds going to Protocol Guild, 20% to Nouns treasury, and 10% to Agora. \n\n\n## What's Agora / Yitong's role in this?\nI'm incredibly excited about more Nouns-produced short films released as Droposals, because there's a real flywheel here if we can demonstrate that Nouns can create super high quality short films that also have real mint value. \n\nIt's why we're working on an [easy Droposals](https://www.nounsagora.com/proposals/346) creator at Agora, and I can think of no better film than one about Ethereum itself to demonstrate the power of Droposals.\n\n\n## Timeline\nDates are approximate, and may change by a few days depending on exact timing of the candidate approval. During the process, Yitong will serve as liaison between The Line and the Nouns community to make sure we have the chance to provide feedback during each phase of production.\n\nw/c 19th Oct - Proposal approved (PAYMENT MILESTONE 1 50%)\nw/c 26th Oct - Creative Phase commences\nw/c 10th Nov - Creative Phase Deck Approval\nw/c 16 Nov - Pre-production commences\nw/c 30th Nov - Edit Lock & Designs approval\nw/c 21th Dec - Layout approve\nw/c 21th Dec - Production commences\nw/c 25 Dec - Christmas Break\nw/c 25th Jan - Animation approve\nw/c 25th Feb - Comp approved\nw/c 22 Feb - Final Delivery (PAYMENT MILESTONE 2 50%)\n\n\n## A story in chapters\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryKSTlTeT.png)\nIf we're successful with this first film, we can serialize this into a series of short animations celebrating major Ethereum milestones so that we can both create an ongoing source of funding for Protocol Guild, and tell an episodic story that builds into a larger narrative and universe that can stand on its own and be appealing to a mass audience who might not even know about Nouns or Ethereum.\n",

The New York evening view from a sailboat is the best place to take photos while wearing Noggles.\n\n*Resubmission notes:\n- As per feedback on [Prop386](https://nouns.wtf/vote/386), I am resubmitting the proposal for NYC.NFT sailing event.\n- I reduced the budget that still can be enough for a classy gathering.\n- You can also mint photos from last event on ZORA*\n\n## Description\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJjKkJqun.jpg)\nFollowing the success of [Prop 102](https://nouns.wtf/vote/102) and [Prop 173](https://nouns.wtf/vote/173), I would like to organize a sailing event on April 3rd in New York with the help of the Manhattan Yacht Club. IMO, it is important to gather at least once a year to celebrate achievements, brainstorm ideas, and share nounish goods. I believe New York is the best place for such gatherings. It was an amazing experience to meet everyone for the first time in person during NFT.NYC 2023. I think next year, we will have even more loyal nounish people visiting New York.\n\n## Burgee flag\nWe have a very beautiful flag with a meaning. *A white flag with red noggles symbolizes one noun! When you put many nouns burgee flags together, they symbolize the Nouns community.* The Nouns burgee flag debuted at the 2023 Nouns Sailing event during NFT.NYC, representing the spirit of Nouns and the tradition of the Nounish community. I would love to continue this tradition to distribute burgee flags at sailing event in NY.\n\n## Mint photos\n[MINT PHOTOS FROM NFTNYC2023 ON ZORA](https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x2d2505a06797a4b6a313c45e201d78834621e2b2)\n\n![](https://pink-feminist-vole-608.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmWfRcMcvTpAaa2KApVzY7vuwWxsDUriPF2TCpj9LJviDd)\n\n# Budget\n- **$18,000** Rent sail yacht Arabella\n- **$12,000** - Food and drinks by Manhattan Yacht Club\n- **$5,000** - 120 Nouns burgee flags\n- **$5,000** - 100 T-shirts (plus art by Messhup)\n- **$5,000** - Airfare and wage for Five\n- **$12,000** - Unexpected expenses (tax, crew allowance etc)\n\n**Subtotal: $58,000**\n\n# Person in Charge\nhttps://twitter.com/fiveoceans_dev\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyyNHcn1p.png)",

Herein, I propose to sell some treasury nouns at prices above the fork0-BV price. This initiative would provide individuals with the opportunity to acquire nouns from Season 1, offer the DAO a chance to expand the Nouners community, in addition to daily auctions, and generate additional capital for proliferation or burn.\nA committee of five trusted members will manage listing of nouns via a 3/5 multi-sig.\n\n## Description\nThis proposal aims to replenish the treasury and secure capital for further proliferation activities. Nouns had historically limited market availability, however there are indications that nouns are in demand; for example, Noun8 was sold for 49 ETH. Now that we have a treasury with lots of rare and beautiful nouns, I propose listing 15 nouns on open markets. This will help the DAO to refill the treasury and also attract new Nouners who appreciate the art, culture, and value of NounsDAO.\nThe committee members will determine prices based on market sentiment and in the best interest of the DAO. All ETH proceeds from sales and any remaining nouns will be transferred to the treasury after one month, which equates to 30 daily auctions.\nHerein, I propose the following tiered pricing for nouns based on their numbers:\n\nids: 0-99 at 43~51 ETH\nids: 100-299 at 38~43 ETH\n\n## Requested nouns\nThe sale of the following nouns should contribute 595~685 ETH to the treasury.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1VxBo_e6.png)\n\n## Policy and Rules\n**1.1** The 15 treasury nouns will be sent to the multi-sig wallet, which is managed by 5 trusted members.\n**1.2** The nouns held in the multi-sig safe are non-voting, meaning that the committee cannot use them for voting purposes.\n**1.3** Committee members will determine prices in the best interest of the DAO.\n**1.4** No treasury nouns shall be sold below the fork0-BV price.\n**1.5** The candidate proposal feedback section shall be used for suggestions.\n**1.6** The community is encouraged to propose committee members, and self-nomination is also encouraged.\n**1.7** All ETH proceeds from sales and any remaining nouns will be transferred to the treasury after one month, which equates to 30 daily auctions.\n\n\n## Multi-sig signers\nThis is a pro bono position, and committee members will receive a small amount of ETH to compensate for transaction fees only.\n\n1. __\n2. __\n3. __\n4. __\n5.

Send 15 treasury nouns with early numbers to multi-sig\n2. Send 1.5 ETH to multi-sig to compensate transaction fees (0.3 eth will be sent to each committee member)\n\n## The proposer\nThis prop was ideated by [Five](https://twitter.com/fiveoceans_dev)\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkBVCcOgT.png)\n",

          "description": "# Unstake all stETH from Lido\n\n*This candidate draft is put forward with the hopes of further feedback from the community.*\n\n#### **Proposal**\nAs good Ethereum citizens [1], I propose we lead by example and unstake all [2] stETH. We currently hold a total of ~10836 stETH in the [treasury](https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0xb1a32FC9F9D8b2cf86C068Cae13108809547ef71).\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJSEZLTeT.png)\n\n\n#### **Problems with Lido**\nI recommend watching the video below to better understand the concerns with Lido, but in short:\n-  Ethereum epochs require 2/3rds of attestors voting to finalize;\n- Lido's node operators control almost 1/3rd of all validators (32.2% at the time of writing);\n- Lido DAO decides who can be a node operator;\n-  In every Lido DAO vote, over 50% of power is controlled by [just 2 or 3 participants](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth);\n-  That makes Lido an Ethereum 'middleware' with a huge amount of centralized power;\n-  The risks are not unrecoverable but serious enough that we ought to choose a better path.\n\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/1k18c2V.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0ddkSa1ZuI&ab_channel=Web3Builders)\n*Lido conversation starts at 17m30s, and ends at 27m30s. Another section on risks starts at 47m30s.*\n\n#### **More resources**\n- The blog post by Danny Ryan referenced in the video:\n[https://github.com/djrtwo/writing/blob/main/docs/2022-05-30_the-risks-of-lsd.md](https://github.com/djrtwo/writing/blob/main/docs/2022-05-30_the-risks-of-lsd.md)\n- Another Evan van Ness podcast with Ben Edgington (issues with governance start around 8min mark):\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGpHXTepcA&ab_channel=Web3Builders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcGpHXTepcA&ab_channel=Web3Builders)\n- Recent Hasu post on future of Lido:\n[https://research.lido.fi/t/hasus-goose-submission-proposed-goals-for-lido-dao-to-consider/5590](https://research.lido.fi/t/hasus-goose-submission-proposed-goals-for-lido-dao-to-consider/5590)\n- Dune dashboard displaying Lido dominance:\n[https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking](https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking)\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJXenQTlp.png)\n\n\n---\n\n#### **Transactions (technicalities)**\nUnstaking from Lido is a [two-step process](https://stake.lido.fi/withdrawals/request). This proposal deals with step one.\n\n- Approve Withdrawal Queue to transfer any stETH amount owned by the DAO.\n    - `0xae7ab96520DE3A18E5e111B5EaAb095312D7fE84.approve(0x889edC2eDab5f40e902b864aD4d7AdE8E412F9B1, uint256.max)`\n- Request to withdraw 10837.24266 stETH. The request is split into batches up to 1K ETH due to a Lido [withdrawal limit](https://etherscan.io/address/0x889edC2eDab5f40e902b864aD4d7AdE8E412F9B1#readProxyContract#F6).\n    - `0x889edC2eDab5f40e902b864aD4d7AdE8E412F9B1.requestWithdrawals([1000 ether, 1000 ether, 1000 ether, 1000 ether, 1000 ether, 1000 ether, 1000 ether, 1000 ether, 1000 ether, 1000 ether, 837.24266 ether], 0xb1a32FC9F9D8b2cf86C068Cae13108809547ef71)`\n\n---\n\n#### **Notes**\n[1] In anticipation of the burn mech, it's necessary for us to reduce our stETH holdings since excess treasury value is denominated in vanilla eth. By reducing stETH, we are _also_ being good Nouns citizens and playing by the intended rules of the burn mechanic.\n\n[2] Assuming this proposal executes, its up to the dao to decide if we want to re-stake, presumably with another solution. This proposal does not make any value judgment around whether Nouns DAO should stake or not; it is solely concerned about the risks of Lido.\n\n*Thanks to Wiz for reading a draft, and Elad for helping with transactions.*\n",

All other assets are ignored.\n\nThe number of auctions looked at when calculating the mean price is a configurable parameter; we suggest starting with 90.\n\nExample based on numbers close to actuals:\n\nTreasury has 2857 ETH, 10830 stETH, 228 rETH.\nAdjusted total supply: 394.\nMean price of last 90 auctions: 30 ETH.\nTreasury value in ETH: 2857 + 10830 + 247 (228 worth of rETH) = 13,934 ETH.\nExcess ETH: 13,934 - 30 * 394 = 2114 ETH.\n\n### What is burned?\n\nOnly ETH is burned. If the Nouns runs out of ETH, it will need to swap other assets (e.g. stETH) into ETH to allow for more burn.\n\n### When can it be called?\n\nThe goal is for the burn to happen at predictable times. One parameter will define what will be the first noun id at which the first burn can happen. Another parameter will define how many noun ids need to be minted before the next burn can happen.\n\nExample:\n\nSuppose the first noun id is set to 1000, and the number of nouns between burns is set to 100. The first burn will be possible once a noun with id 1000 is minted. The next burn would be possible once a noun with id 1100 is minted.\n\nEven if the first burn actually occurs when noun 1002 is auctioned, the next burn will still be possible starting id 1100.\n\n\n### Timelock upgrade\n\nThe timelock will be upgraded to a new version which will allow the burner contract to call it an burn ETH.\n\nThe timelock will only allow the burner contract to call it.\n\nThe address of the burner contract is a configurable param. Setting it to the zero address is effectively turning off the burn mechanism.\n\n\n## Audit costs\n\nOur plan is to undergo a deep code review with solimander, and an audit with [Sherlock](https://www.sherlock.xyz/). In a bit more detail:\n\n1. Soli review (+ verbs fix things)\n2. Sherlock audit\n3. Verbs fix things + soli reviews fixes\n4. Sherlock mitigation review\n\nWe are asking for 36K USDC to be sent to the Tech Grants Pod multisig to pay for the audit. 30K USDC will go to auditors and 6K USDC will go to Sherlock.\n\n## Next steps\n\nFunding the audit will let us know the DAO wants the burn to be deployed. Once funded we will finalize the code, undergo the audit, and follow up with a proposal to upgrade the auction house contract and the treasury contract.\n\nThe upgrade will leave the burn disabled, since it seems best to separate the deployment of the mechanism from reaching consensus on its parameters. We will of course support any voters who will want to follow up with a proposal to set the burn parameters.\n\nIt's also worthwhile for voters to consider converting stETH into ETH ahead of the burn, since as mentioned above this simple design only burns native ETH.\n\n## Appendix: pseudocode\n\nExcessETHBurner:\n\n```\n\n// configurable params:\n\nuint numPastAuctions;\n\nuint nextBurnNounId;\n\nuint mintsBetweenBurns;\n\nfunction burnExcessETH() {\n\n    if (auction().nounId &lt; nextBurnNounId) revert('Not yet');\n\n    \n\n    allowedTreasuryInETH = adjustTotalSupply() * meanAuctionPrice();\n\n    excessETH = treasuryValueInETH() - allowedTreasuryInETH;\n\n    amountToBurn = min(excessETH, timelock.balance);\n\n    \n\n    nextBurnNounId += mintsBetweenBurns;\n\n    \n\n    timelock.burnETH(amountToBurn);\n\n}\n\nfunction treasuryValueInETH() {\n\n    return timelock.balance + stETH.balanceOf(timelock) + \n\n        wETH.balanceOf(timelock) + rETH.getEthValue(rETH.balanceOf(timelock));\n\n}\n\nfunction meanAuctionPrice() {\n\n    return mean(auctionHouse.prices(numPastAuctions));\n\n}\n\n```\n\n\n## Appendix: current asset breakdown\n\nAt the time of writing this text, [according to Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0xb1a32FC9F9D8b2cf86C068Cae13108809547ef71):\n\n\n\n* Total treasury value is roughly $23.15M.\n* Its two main assets are:\n    * ETH at $4.391M (2631.493 ETH).\n    * stETH at $18.061M (10830.768 stETH).\n* These two assets alone make up over 96.7% of the total treasury value.\n* USDC is roughly 1.1% of the treasury, and we’re comfortable ignoring it for the sake of code simplicity.\n* wstETH is roughly 0.11% and is ignored as well.",

          "description": "# GLITCH: Art residency + Prop House + Droposal\n\n# \n\n# DESCRIPTION\n## TLDR;\nGLITCH is a 2-weeks residency for blockchain artists and engineers embracing the principles of openness and collaboration. We want to set up a Prop House to fund public goods projects and artworks within the GLITCH collective and beyond, where the highest-ranked artworks will be submitted as a Droposal for Nouns.\n\n**Total funds requested: 25 ETH**\n* 10 ETH for the GLITCH residency (see below for more granular budget)\n* 15 ETH for the Prop House Treasury\n\n![GLITCH Community](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=126XxNSe_cLiVf0vE7tPmRHelc9c28-dg)\n\n# GLITCH 3.0\nThe GLITCH art collective is organising the third edition of its art residency. It’s a 2 weeks long event gathering blockchain / AI artists and engineers, collaborating on the creation of new NFT collections inspired by the notion of CC-0 and Remix. GLITCH is a unique opportunity to build new types of public goods, past editions have led to the creation of several protocols (e.g. REMIX NFT, IMPACT NFT) as well as an open source NFT Token-Bound Licensing standard to embed Creative Commons-like licensing conditions directly into NFTs.\n\n## ART RESIDENCY\nGLITCH is a two-week focused residency at an 18th century chateau in France. About 40-50 participants will be invited to create, imagine, develop theories, build projects and standards aimed at supporting a new creative ecosystem of open creativity and digital abundance in the blockchain art world.  The participants will be a highly curated group of creative and smart individuals actively engaged with NFTs, art, music and AI. The goal is to bring the right people, in the right place, at the right time, and then let the magic happen.\n\nAt GLITCH, we strive to empower people with ideas, visions, and expertise, while providing space for our attendees to reach deep into their minds and forge better models together. We exist to disrupt the status quo and to manifest positive solutions for society.\nThe outcomes of the residency will be, first and foremost, a tight community of value-aligned people eager to collaborate with one another, new collaborations and synergies in order to shape the world of tomorrow. The residency will also promote a variety of new initiatives about how to promote the value of openness and interoperability in the blockchain art world. Expected deliverables include new NFT protocols that encourage remix and creativity, new NFT protocols geared towards maximization of social and environmental impact, as well as a variety of collaborative exhibitions for NFT artists. All content produced within the residency will be released and made available to all under Creative Commons licenses.\n\nMore details about the third edition of GLITCH can be found at the [following link](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1xWfm3HfZJHDdlb8-7bhrVE4fWmNJDOhd)\n\n![GLITCH overview](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1EHB6ZJxOhGZOb1wWWz1YobCez6UViYop)\n\n# GLITCH Prop House & Droposal\n\nGLITCH is an avant-garde hub for blockchain art and innovation. We aim to utilize Prop House's pioneering mechanism to fund the creation of artworks and public goods that will be stewarded and/or mentored by the members of the GLITCH collective (artists, engineers, curators, etc). By harnessing Prop House's governance system, we aim to democratize the funding process, foster cross-pollination between the Nouns and GLITCH community, and support projects that contribute significantly to the blockchain art ecosystem.\n\n## GLITCH Prop House\n\nGLITCH will create a Prop House round for blockchain artists and engineers to propose artworks and public goods to be created during the GLITCH residency. Artworks can range from NFTs to physical installations; public good initiatives can range from developing open standard or open-source tools, organizing educational events, or supporting initiatives to promote the blockchain art space. Collaboration between artists, technologists, and other stakeholders will be strongly encouraged, leading to the creation of groundbreaking initiatives in the blockchain art world, and beyond.\n\nAnyone can submit a proposal for a new artwork or public good and request a maximum of 3 ETH. The GLITCH and Nouns community members assess the proposals and vote to allocate funds to the initiatives that align with GLITCH's mission of openness, collaboration, and innovation. Votes can be cast both by Nouns holders and GLITCH-NFT holders (we will distribute a GLITCH-NFT to all current and previous GLITCH participants, around 90 people total). Nouns and GLITCH-NFTs have an equal weight of one vote. We want Nouns holders to have a say on the selection of the proposed projects so that we can get feedback from outside of the event, to ensure that the projects that are funded are relevant not only to the GLITCH community, but also to other communities across the Nouns and NFT space.\n\n## GLITCH DROPOSAL\n\nThe successful proposals, if applicable (i.e. to the extent that they include the production of a digital artwork), will be proposed as a Droposal for Nouns. The proceeds from the Droposal will be split equally between Nouns DAO, GLITCH and the creator(s) of the artwork.\n\n![GLITCH people](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1LWgWO67u5aDXgF7vP5rQej8bkIDPJL1M)\n\n# FUNDINGS\n\nThe full costs of the residency is **$60,000** (inclusive of accommodation and catering for all participants). We are requesting **10 ETH** to cover 1/4 of the costs. \n\nThe Prop House will fund proposals for up to **3 ETH per proposal**. We need **15 ETH** to support at least 5 proposals.\n\n\nWe are requesting a total grant of **25 ETH** in order to implement this proposal:\n* **10 ETH**: support of the GLITCH residency\n* **15 ETH**: Prop House treasury\n\n# TEAM\nThe GLITCH collective is stewarded by [Primavera De Filippi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primavera_De_Filippi), [Will Papper](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wpapper/), [Isaac Patka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaac-patka-417b4328/) and many other amazing blockchain artists and engineers !\n\n\n\n\n",

          "description": "# 🧈 The Churn\n\n//This is a proposal to protocolize distribution of Nouns that have been returned to the treasury via a permissionless forum similar to Prop House, allocated by Nouner vote. \n\n\nOne way to understand the falling demand / fork cycle is as a referendum on the protocol's ability to maintain alignment with an expanding voter base. \n\nWe may want to enshrine, as the highest order mandate for voters, that we aim to produce not near-term roi but a rich, magnetic culture anchored by a progressively more distributed governance network. With or without v3, it's more important token-holders stay than that they come in the first place. \n\nThus\n\nRather than be focused on protecting price/bv, we could instead prioritize minimizing forks, not just when auction prices are low but high as well. The two objectives are likely at odds in the long term. The dao has already proved that it will de-circulate Nouns if it serves near-term capital interests. Attempting to peg auction price to treasury balance via a periodic burn does not fundamentally change this.\n\nBecause\n\nAs long as natural demand is falling (price<bv), the highest marginal buyer at auction is still likely to be a value extractor. This is self-evident when fork threshold < allowed burn frequency, but is also the case generally. There is no way to eliminate the arb under this market condition via burn, meaning there can be be little/no supply expansion under price contraction.  \n\nAnd \n\nWhen periods of price & supply expansion (price>bv) reverse, the dao will be under significant & possible cascading exit pressure in the form of profit-taking. We may find the token supply ultimately little changed. Nouns lifers will be palliated by an increased voting share in the dao (as with fork # 0), rather than rightfully held to task for failing to value progressive decentralization, inclusivity and organic leadership churn.  \n\nAnd So \n\nI suggest we encode the recirculation of treasury nouns at a predictable cadence after forks (N/year until fully distributed). \n\nFork execution schedules a series of on-chain prop house-style rounds (perhaps triggered by a modified auction settlement process?) where anyone can apply to be granted a Noun via a weighted vote governed by Noun-owners. Imo the most visceral/memetic steady-state value for N is 365. We can ramp up responsibly but lets not take an eternity. \n\nThis maximizes alignment on growing the Nouns holder base, rather than near-term auction demand, minimizes arb interest and downstream rugs. It affords ardent Nouns believers a direct, merit-based pathway to agency in the network, and demonstrates we are immutably committed to a diverse and expanding range of interesting voices contributing to the conversation- the highest good for us, Ethereum, and beyond.\n\nNouns belong to the world.",

          "description": "# Nouns Stories + Stoopid Buddy = Shorts Galore\n\n# \n\n# \n\n## TLDR\n\nOn the heels of [Prop 180](https://nouns.wtf/vote/180)’s and [Prop 73](https://nouns.wtf/vote/73)’s overwhelming success, we’re rallying the creative forces once again on what promises to be our biggest and most impactful proposal yet. Nouns Stories is seeking $1,795,000 to develop, produce and distribute over 50 Animated Nouns Shorts on a global scale with nine time Emmy-Award winners Stoopid Buddy Stoodios, along with 50 of the best animators in the world.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyIYuo7gp.png)\n\n[Nouns Short Shorts Trailer](https://youtu.be/QxrvHepTh38)\n\n## NOUNS: FRONT AND CENTER\n\nMost sources of financing for animated content are tied to networks that move at a snail’s pace and that are not considered artist friendly. This is where Nouns steps in to disrupt the system. We want to provide the proper funding to attract the world’s best animators, help them bring their ideas to life, and in so doing — put Nouns DAO on the map as the number one source for innovative, diverse storytelling in animation. \n\nNot only that, but by making Nouns DAO the seed funder we’re putting the Nouns IP (and the brand’s aesthetic) front and center on a series of innovative and hilarious shorts that are bound to get massive amounts of attention with animation fans all around the world. What better way to spread the Nounish vibes and garner some positive attention?\n\n## PERSON, PLACE & THING: 3 THEMATIC ROUNDS, 50 CREATORS, 1 YEAR\n\nOver the course of the next twelve months we’ll onboard 50 of the world’s most innovate animators to create engaging animated shorts featuring great characters, engaging storylines, and Nounish vibes. By expanding the run times and upping the budgets, we’ll give the animators the opportunity to produce even MORE engaging visuals and storylines!\n\nWe’ll roll out the animated shorts over three themed rounds. Other than requiring the films to feature Nouns characters or Noggles, we’ll encourage the animators to go absolutely wild with the best and funniest ideas: the ones that may not exist within the walled gardens of Hollywood. Because not every artist has the bandwidth to produce longer form shorts, we’ll keep the Short Shorts 15 second+ format for some of our creators. \n\nIn total the three themed rounds will feature:\n\n- 12 x 2-3 minute Shorts\n- 38 x 15-30 second Short Shorts\n- 3 original shorts by the team at Stoopid Buddy\n\n## 50 OF THE WORLD’S BEST\n\nWe’ll cast our net wide to onboard the best animators we can muster, and by allowing them the creative freedom to ***************do what they do***************, we believe we’ll get the very best out of them. Not only that, but many of these talented folks already have huge followings online which will further expose the Nouns DAO to their legions of fans when we go live with the shorts and the post them to their own socials.\n\n## 3 STOOPID SHORTS\n\nTo kick off each thematic round, Stoopid Buddy Stoodios will pour all of their Nouns-lovin’-energy (see: Rose Parade / forthcoming Nouns Documentary) into making something truly special for Nouns — a love letter in animation like only they can. They’ll tap their A-list Buddies to create and voice these fully original mini-movies, creating some hilarious cohesion to what promises to be a wildly eclectic program!\n\n## CC0 Heroes\n\nAs we did in the first Nouns Short Shorts Festival, we’ll encourage each animator to embrace Nounish culture by opting in to making their shorts CC0. While it won’t be required, opting into to CC0 will make their films eligible for some damn [fine awards](https://twitter.com/nouns_stories/status/1670029456688418818) and cash prizes!\n\n## OH YEAH…ONE MORE THING\n\nWe’ll be hosting a *Nountastic* IRL animation festival to premiere these amazing shorts, attracting Nounish animation fans from all over the world.   Why do this when we could just hide behind the safety of our computer monitors? Because as we experienced with the first screening at [Braindead Studios](https://studios.wearebraindead.com/) in Los Angeles (in conjunction with the Melbourne screening at Pixel), there’s an *energy* and *magic* to bringing communities together to share in a truly unique experience that will help put Nouns DAO on the map. We’ll invite all our industry pals, and will we live-stream the whole thing just as we did before? Abso-fucking-lutely!\n\n## IMPACT: NETWORK EFFECT\n\nThe first round of shorts garnered over **a million views** in the first month of release across creator and owned social channels. Most of these views were native to the creator channels of the animators themselves — providing a whole new audience for Nouns. This time around, we’ll not only continue to seek out animators with their own audiences, but amplify views across all platforms with a social media marketing campaign and enlisting a PR firm to bolster [awareness](https://www.animationmagazine.net/2023/07/stoopid-buddy-stoodios-chris-waters-unzips-about-the-nouns-short-shorts-festival/) of what we’re up to. On top of this, to build anticipation and excitment for the festival as the year unfolds, we'll create original promotional content, including teasers and trailers, behind the scenes footage, and creator profiles.\nCheck out some of the postings from our first Shorts Shorts Festival below!\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hy2i70Kxa.jpg)](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Ctm_qiRBIre/)\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/By3o7AtxT.jpg)](https://www.instagram.com/p/CttDyBBo33G/)\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S13oQ0Yxp.jpg)](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CtgbaWPJ9iK/)\n\n\n## THE NOUNS STORIES TEAM\n\n**Stoopid Buddy Stoodios**\n\n9 time Emmy-winning studio behind *Robot Chicken,* and producer of over 1,000 hours of animated television **including: *Crossing Swords, Mickey Saves Christmas, and Marvel’s MODOK.* Stoopid Buddy is a pioneering independent studio that has helped drive the tremendous growth in adult animation over the past decade. Co-founder Eric Towner and Head of Development Chris Waters have deep roots in the Nouns ecosystem. Their first proposal funded the Nouns Rose Parade Float (seen by over 30 million people) and both are producers of the forthcoming documentary about Nouns.\n\n**Walter Newman**\n\nFormer SVP of program development at Adult Swim who oversaw such shows as Rick & Morty, Tuca and Bertie, Smiling Friends, Black Dynamite, and more. Walter brings network experience and a deep talent roster to the Nouns Stories team.\n\n**Goldy** / **Pixel**\n\n**[Goldy's](https://twitter.com/Goldypix)** Oscar-Shortlisted hybrid production studio is behind **[nounish ⌐◨-◨](https://twitter.com/nounish)** and the animated short film \"**[The Wizards Hat](https://twitter.com/nouns_stories/status/1570433066900017152?s=20&t=T_vYbAun_YQEsZUlEwfjSA)**\" from the original Nouns Stories proposal.\n\n**Joshua Fisher**\n\nManager of Grammy-winning music producers, music publisher, SharkDAO Rep, Ugly Noun, The Nouns Square co-founder, Nouns DAO Builder and Nouns narrative advocate.\n\n**Joel Cares**\n\nCEO of **[Lobal Global](https://lobal.global/) / [ANOA](https://anoa.ca)**, creator of **[Nerman](https://twitter.com/nermanbot)**, founding member of **[Nouncil](http://nouncil.wtf/)**, creative director @ [**JoelCares.net**](https://joelcares.net).\n\n## OUR ROLES\n\nWe’ve got the experience, knowledge, and relationships to successfully pull off this wildly ambitious proposal. Not only will we be identifying top-tier talent from our own networks of creators, but we’ll also be recruiting on a global scale to identify and onboard the next generation of up-and-coming animation talent.\n\nWe’ll be managing and coordinating a massive effort to create decentralized content and creatively package it in a way that connects with audiences around the globe. Not only that, but we’ll be tapping our extensive network to best position our exposure and distribution of the program online, at festivals, and beyond. We’ll be coordinating a social media / marketing and PR strategy, as well as presenting “behind the scenes” access and status updates to the DAO as this undertaking fully develops.\n\n## BEYOND THE PROP\n\nThe Nouns Stories team has over 613,620ish hours of experience in animation development, production, marketing, distribution and sales. Our team is well positioned to take these Nounish creations beyond what is promised in the proposal. Our hope is we can continue to develop the best-of-the-best beyond their existence as a short, and seed Nounish content and characters into the mainstream zeitgeist. Think about it — *The Simpsons*, *South Park*, *Rick & Morty*, and hell, even *Robot Chicken*, all got their start **********as animated shorts.**********\n\n## THAT’S A WRAP!\n\nAnimation drives cultural conversation. There’s a white space in animation that Nouns DAO is uniquely positioned to fill. Nimble development. Artist friendly. Global reach. We believe there’s a more “Nounish” way to produce the next great animated shorts, and that we have the team to help find them and make them. \n\nFor Nouns, there’s an opportunity to be front-and-center in one of the most passionate arenas in pop culture and create break-out successes that proliferate the meme.\n\nOur team has poured our hearts and souls into the Nouns experiment since it’s inception, and we’ve proven we can develop world-class animation and execute on ambitious ideas. We believe in a new way of generating content and organizing passionate communities of creators and fans. Together we can change the culture and build Nouns DAO into the next great destination for animation, so slap on your dang Noggles and let’s do this!!\n\n## BUDGET BREAKDOWN\n\n**TOTAL: $1,795,000 USDC** \n50% distributed upon commencement, 50% upon completion of first round.\n\n**Animation** **************Content - $1,270,000**************\n\n- 12 x 2-3 min shorts (3 rounds, 4 per round, $20k/short) - $240K\n- 38 x 15-30 sec Short Shorts (3 rounds, 12 to 13 shorts per round, $7.5k/short) - $285K\n- Three Original Shorts + packaging from Stoopid Buddy - $450K\n- Nounish Trailers / Behind-the-Scenes / Festival Recap Docs / Creator Profiles - $150K\n- “CC0 Hero” Awards (3 rounds, 15K per round) - $45K\n- Animation Festival - $100K\n\n**Management and Production - $430K** \n\n- Exec Producer Fees - $300K\n    - artist outreach and curation\n    - creative oversight and curation\n    - promotion\n- Producer - $100K\n    - Animator management\n    - Scheduling, Accounting and Deliverables\n- Web build and upkeep - $30K\n\n************************************General Operations - $95K************************************\n\n- Publicist - $15K\n- Social Media Mgr - $15K\n- Legal+Accounting - $20K\n- Event Planner - $20K\n- Team Travel & Accommodation - allow $25K",

          "description": "# Noun en Scène (aka Mise en Scène with Noun 'Muppets') - TAKE 2!!\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyewEPEla.gif)\n\n### This is a resubmission of [Prop 371](https://nouns.wtf/vote/371). \n\nAnd if you're asking yourself, **'What's changed, Chris?'** Let me provide you with a quick and handy summary up top: \n\n#### **The Noun Ask**\nSome nuance was missing in the previous prop. I love the idea of 'earning' a Noun, and since (at the present moment) there is no defined way to do that, I decided to build it into the prop itself as a way to indicate that interest. \n\n**This 'earning' is not, however, a transaction in the current prop** but will instead be in a future prop that allows Nouners to vote on whether a Noun is **deserved or not** once everyone has seen the epically awesome results!\n\n#### **The Story** \nSome of you also wanted to hear a little bit more about the story these images would be capturing and I'm more than happy to oblige because for me, it's the characters, story and nounish themes that are the most exciting things about getting to execute 'Noun en Scène'. \n\nI see the Nouns as little, innocent agents of change, who are chock-full of optimism and doing their best - pulled and directed by their noggles - to go around and help people, even if they have no freakin' idea how! They might screw up, they might not know what they're doing, but that's never going to stop them from trying their gosh darn hardest to do some good! \n\nAnd to explore these ideas, I did a fun jam session working on a series document and a pilot 'scriptment' (*neither are finished or definitive, but a step in the creative discovery process that gives me a jumping off point as we continue to develop character, story and themes*) for the nounish show, 'G◨-◨D INTENTIONS', that doesn't exist, but whose episodes 'Noun en Scène' will capture cinematic stills from, making it seem like this nounish 'Muppet' show IS a real thing: *[WORKING SERIES DOCUMENT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sNWmF0Lhlqe7bRMHra9EKHyoLSPr3B1CDIwSJJw8sTs/edit?usp=sharing)*\n\n#### **Distribution Clarification** \nThe main goal of this project is to get these images out into the world so that people can see them and get curious about Nouns. And I think putting these kind of high-quality, cinematic images in places where NFTs are not often seen (specifically billboards but  also super large format at a gallery show) will allow them to function as both **quirky advertisments for Nouns and high quality art pieces that connect with people outside of this space**. \n\nThere is not, however, an ask for funds for the billboards or gallery rentals in this prop because I intend to do a **Droposal** afterwards where all of the NFT sales revenue goes towards this exact distribution effort (Yitong, let's talk!). **Digital funding physical!**\n\nAs mentioned in the prop, we will also be documenting the process of the creation of these images, so I foresee quite a lot of BTS content that is going to be going up through Zora and socials (maybe we could even do a **Nounish vid about it??**).\n\n#### And finally, **Project Clarification** \nI could've used this prop to ask for development funds for a script and storyboards and gone a more traditional route, but **I think that the deliverables coming out of this being able to live as a **finished photography series/art project** unto itself is far more exciting!** \n\nThis doesn't mean that I want the project to end or plan to end it after this prop's deliverables - *I mean, c'mon, we're going to have two incredible Noun 'Muppets' to create with!* - simply that **utilizing funds to execute high-quality, finished images that we can use to make people Noun-curious in IRL spaces right away** is far better than having *only* developed material with the *intention* to do more. \n\nWe want to deliver something final AND ALSO intend to do more :) \n\n\n### **And with that...** \n**Please find the sturdy bones of the previous prop with these updates incorporated below** 👇\n\n---\n# **TL;DR**\n\n**Cinematic stills from a television series that doesn't exist (yet!) starring Chip - a cookie Noun - and Benny - a rabbit Noun- in the surreal, funny and over-the-top adventures they find themselves on while trying to do good in the world.**\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJ1-5UUsh.png)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r17M9IIs2.png)\n\n\n# **TELL YOU MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT? WHY OF COURSE!**\n\nA single frame can tell an entire story. It can draw you in. Make you think. Send you tumbling towards what happens next… \n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyoqtGsuh.jpg)\n(*let’s put some Noggles on Roger*)\n\nIt’s what the best films do. I mean look at that Roger Rabbit still. What are Roger and Eddie looking at? What’s about to happen? And why are they handcuffed together?! Not to mention location, costumes, use of lighting or even the colors! There’s a palpable tension and curiosity in that single frame that makes us **care**. \n\nI want to bring that to a fun art project focused on a pair of Nouns - Chip and Benny - and their adventures in the - slightly (or sometimes *very*) heightened and over-the-top - world of ‘**Noun en Scène**’.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJmaYfou3.png)\n\nThink of it as a cinematic one-shot storytelling project that takes our pixelated, digital little Nouns, turns them into real life ‘muppet’-like puppets and then throws them into film scenes with flesh and blood people.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkwdXQiu3.jpg)\n(*cinematic scenes that make you ask questions and keep looking*)\n\nEvery one-shot tosses our sweet, little Nouns into a new dramatic scene where they're forced to deal with the crazy situation they've gotten themselves into by trying to help or do a good deed for a random human they've met. \n\nAnd through these scenic moments, the world of Chip, Benny and the 'Noun en Scène' project will grow, evolve and hopefully become something people want to see more of!\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJMTUmid2.jpg)\n\nBy utilizing ‘Muppet’-like characters mixed with real people and heightened, cinematically-lit scenes, the absurdity and beauty of life will become that much more stark, profound and hopefully very funny. \n\nTaking cues and paying homage to a variety of influences including Alex Prager, The Far Side, world cinema, the Kermitage Collection and many more, this project aims to utilize a couple Nouns to create captivating characters we just can’t get enough of. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1_riGoO3.jpg)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1dHszjOn.jpg)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkX_jzi_h.jpg)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1CuBtIjh.jpg)\n\n\nChip and Benny are just a couple innocent, little guys trying to help and do good in the world, but instead they keep finding themselves entangled in situations way beyond their depth. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJCRRGj_3.jpg)\n\n# **COOL. SO WHAT’S THE PLAN?**\n\nThese shoots will be treated like an indie film production - the difference being that we are capturing **single shots** that tell full, rich stories while still requiring casting, makeup, lighting, location scouting/rentals, puppet styling etc. \n\nOn the casting front, while at first it will make sense to work with local working actors/models and friends, as the project gains traction and grows - or when I’m working on my next tv show - I think there is a fun way to bring known name actors into these scenes and add a whole other level of playfulness to the project. \n\nThe first step will be designing, modeling and manufacturing our Noun ‘muppets.’ **Luckily, I’ve gotten a very exciting collaborator on board for this!**\n\n# **PUPPET HEAP!**\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJrVNiKx6.png)](https://youtu.be/agxY_pJwo8o?feature=shared)\n\n\n**Puppet Heap** is a unique design and production studio specializing in storytelling through the creation of iconic characters for all sorts of media including film, television, advertising, theater, and new media. The company was founded by artist, designer, filmmaker, and teacher Paul Andrejco after observing the burgeoning pile of puppets that had accumulated in his Hoboken apartment back in the early ‘90s. Now, just a few blocks away, Puppet Heap is home to teams of artists, designers, writers, and producers creating character based narratives for clients around the world including **The Walt Disney Company, Sesame Workshop, and Nickelodeon**. Puppet Heap has been entrusted with the care, maintenance, and creative support of the Muppets for Disney’s **The Muppets Studio** since 2006.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyX40MsOh.jpg)\n(*Puppet Heap team on set of Imagine Dragon's 'Radioactive'*)\n\nPuppet Heap loves the project - *I nounspilled them* - and will be joining to design and create the physical puppets of Chip and Benny. And as scale and scope continue to evolve in their journey (we have big plans), they’ll be there, helping to tell their growing story - and all the other Nouns that come into play too.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJXG1rDp2.jpg)\n\n# **AWESOME! AND WHAT ABOUT ME?**\n\nMy name is Chris Martin - not of Coldplay, sorry - and I’ve been making independent, global film and television productions for a decade plus now - primarily in Korea.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HklvCzid2.jpg)\n\nMost recently, I co-created, co-wrote, directed, showran,and EP’ed 20 episodes of a show called 'Dramaworld' currently streaming on Amazon that stars well-known actors including Liv Hewson (‘Yellowjackets’, ‘Santa Clarita Diet’), Brett Gray (‘I’m a Virgo’, ‘On My Block’), Daniel Dae Kim (‘Lost’, ‘Hawaii 5-0’), Ha Jiwon (‘Secret Garden’) and K-pop star Henry Lau.\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryG2-7jun.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/Dramaworld-2/dp/B09QWZ45Y1)\n\nWith everything I create, I try to lean into **a playful, magical realist tone that’s grounded in heart**, which is the kind of storytelling that I think is not only a perfect fit for Nouns, but also an incredible way to bring people into this journey of Chip and Benny as they go around trying to help.\n\n\n\nI love everything about Nouns - the ethos, the support for creative, weird projects, and did I mention the freakin’ Noggles?! - and have been trying to figure out how I could do something creative that furthered that mission for quite awhile now. \n\nThen suddenly, while wandering around a street festival the other day, I saw this:\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkmKCfj_3.jpg)\n\n**And bingo! 💡**\n\nThe idea for ‘Noun en Scène’ landed fully formed in my brain! And I knew I had to make it a reality and see what it could eventually become!\n\n# **WHY SHOULD NOUNS FUND THIS?**\n\nStorytelling is everything - always has been. And in a world where we are inundated with ‘content’ online, a playful, quirky and precise project like this will be a breath of fresh air to stand out against the noise.\n\nUtilizing photography as a medium and consistent characters as the subject will allow fans to come back, excited to see where the journey of Chip and Benny will lead and who they'll be trying to 'help' next. \n\nAnd by staging everything down to the last detail, each photographic story that comes out of ‘Noun en Scène’ will simultaneously be a fine art piece, a Sunday (web)comic and continuous character development leading to a broader (and very Noun-curious) audience. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r12QW7iuh.jpg)\n\nAnd in the spirit of '**mint everything**,' we are planning to utilize Zora to **mint and document our progress** - design sketches, scripts, behind the scenes, etc. It feels like a great way to document the process of creation and build something creative in public. \n\n# **Speaking of creative, meet Benny!**\nHere's Paul's initial design for Benny:\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1YB-Han3.jpg)\n\nArms and legs, oh my! With our puppets, we want to keep what makes Nouns distinct while adding a whole new flavor that brings them to life and gives them character. \n\n### **The (mis)adventures of Chip and Benny** \nBy creating empathy and connection with our two little Nouns through **visual storytelling**, the project will help spread Nouns and nounish-ness far and wide - just how Chip and Benny would want it. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJIwS910n.jpg)\n(*One-shot example sketch - 'Chip and Benny Check for- AHHHHH!'*)\n\nAnd we plan to have this first leg of the project culminate in a **fun droposal** that takes Chip and Benny IRL in eye-catching ways (*see below for a tease*). \n\n# **THE ASK AKA THE BUDGET**\n\nWe want to propose a tight, but realistic budget that still allows us to execute this at the highest professional standards, so that we can first not only prove the concept, but create something that rivals the quality of anything you'd see in a high budget studio release. \n\nWe want to go above and beyond everyone’s expectations for what 'Noun en Scène' can be because seeing is believing and we think this initial batch of scenes will prove the potential of building out characters in a uniquely nounish way and make people want to see where we can go with Chip and Benny in the future. \n\n**BUDGET:**\n* **$40,000 USDC (2 puppets x $20,000 USDC/puppet)** **one-time cost** for the design and fabrication of our ‘Noun Muppets’ - this allows Puppet Heap to design, costume and build out Chip and Benny in their physical ‘muppet’-ish forms (**to be used again and again as the project continues and evolves**).\n* **$50,000 USDC** production budget to shoot and finish (at least) 5 'one-shots' - this will be a fully crewed up shoot with actors, set design, hair & makeup etc. and the budget will be used to pay crew, rent equipment, secure locations, finish photos in post etc. (all the production related expenses)\n* **Detailed breakdown** to give a general idea of how the funds will be used **[HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yym2vm-ojk9sXjrwziRHCDY6VYrSZPva3XBaryZLFUY/edit?usp=sharing)**\n* **Potentially 1 Noun** - If the results are of a quality that Nouners think warrants it, I ask that **another prop be put up to vote on whether a Noun (Noun 483, cookie head Noun from the treasury) has been 'earned' and can be sent as a reward**. A big part of why I'm doing this is be able to participate more fully and help provide a voice to shape the Nouns ecosystem going forward and I believe becoming a Noun holder is the next step to that!\n\n**TOTAL BUDGET: $90,000 USDC + Potentially 1 NOUN (tbd by future proposal)**\n\n**PAYMENT ADDRESS:**\nnoun-en-scene.eth\n0x6Ccb83c907dBf0B4bc28f9BF83173b0ab943350B\n\n# **TIMELINE**\n\nUpon prop passing, we can make our puppets and be in production in approximately **2.5 months** and aiming to have finished images ready **~1 month later**.\n\nAll the while **minting our progress and creative developments** on Zora.\n\n# **FUTURE STEPS**\n\nMy aim is to use the project to develop the characters and story of these two best friends on their journey to help and do good - even if it always seems to go a little sideways - in a surprising novel and onchain way. 'Noun en Scène' as the first piece will allow us to capture cinematic moments that bring Nouns into the real(ish) world and, hopefully, helps people fall in love with Chip, Benny and their continued adventures.\n\nWhich brings me back to the aforementioned droposal! \n\nWhat better way to take this project out into the world than through a **Droposal whose sales revenue will 100% go to getting these images up onto billboards and putting together a gallery show of a select number of physicals.** \n\nMore on both those soon! \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJFGYFIi3.jpg)\n(⌐◨-◨'s *on billboards?*)\n\n\nPaul and I have a ton of fun ideas for where to take this and how to grow it, so we're looking forward to what we can achieve this go round while keeping our minds open to how it can be expanded!\n\nThank you for taking the time to read and look forward to making the world a little more nounish!\n\n**Time for Chip, Benny and their friends to save the world. One good deed at a time!**\n\n*Keep Nouns weird.*\n\n-Chris",

          "description": "# Add a Dynamic Reserve Price for the Auctions\n\nHello, we are the founding and operating members of the Japanese-speaking sub-DAO, [pNouns](https://pnouns.wtf/), (owning Noun #553/#556), and the members of [Crypto Learning Club (CLC)](https://cryptolearningclub.org/), (owning Noun #605/#606).\n\n## TL;DL\n- Observing the stagnant winning bids for #853 / #854 / #855 auctions (just under 20ETH), it is evident that the current NFT auction system is likely to attract even more arbitrageurs.\n- The increase in arbitrageurs will lead to a stagnation in NounsDAO by strategically opposing any proposals made during the first fork.\n- In order to continue the auctions while preventing the entry of arbitrageurs, we propose a contract to set the dynamic reserve price for NFT auctions at a value equal to or greater than the current pro-rata share of a single Noun = \"the treasury at the start of the auction divided by the number of remaining NFTs.\"\n\n\n**Note**\n\nWe propose this as a candidate proposal to start a discussion within the community. Any feedback is welcome. We will update the proposal documents [here](https://github.com/openreachtech/nounsdao-proposals). As for the future process, if there is enough support for adding a dynamic reserve price, we would like to update the candidate proposal and submit the implementation part as well.\n\n## Structural Issues Facing NounsDAO\n\n### What's Happening?\nAs of August 2023, the treasury wallet, managed on the smart contract, holds nearly 30,000 ETH as the operational fund for the DAO. These funds have been allocated to the roughly 10 proposals posted every week for various grants (ranging from tens to hundreds of ETH) to support branding activities for Nouns' automatically generated on-chain meme characters and to expand NounsDAO's \"Nounish philosophy\" worldwide. \n\nHowever, after the FTX incident in November 2022 and the subsequent decline in the NFT and blockchain market, the average price of a Noun, which was previously being auctioned for an average of 50-100 ETH per day, plummeted to 30-35 ETH.\n\nAs a result, by dividing the approximately 30,000 ETH pooled in the treasury wallet by the number of NFTs issued, and utilizing the commonly employed 'rage quit' function found in other DAOs, it became possible to liquidate Nouns when market conditions deteriorated. Recognizing this opportunity, arbitrageurs began to form a faction anticipating liquidation within NounsDAO to seek profit from the situation.\n\nFor this faction, the ETH accumulated in the treasury wallet translates to casting \"Against\" votes for any proposal that could potentially reduce the ETH they receive when liquidating their Nouns. As a result, NounsDAO's activities stagnated for nearly six months from early 2023 onwards.\n\n\nIn response to this, a solution arose from within the DAO, combining an on-chain forking mechanism with the “rage quit” function. Despite encountering some challenges along the way, this feature gained approval through on-chain voting, ultimately culminating in the first fork.\n\nThe majority of Nouns, along with the treasury wallet, sided with the faction anticipating liquidation. This resulted in the burning of the majority of Nouns, approximately 35 ETH was liquidated as the faction departed.\n\nThe holders that remain in the main NounsDAO own roughly 380 Nouns, sharing a belief in Nouns' long-term vision, along with a treasury wallet holding 13,000 ETH. The DAO was set for a fresh start.\n\nHowever, recent signs indicate a looming issue. This is evident in the recent auctions, #853 / #854 / #855, where winning bids have dipped below 20 ETH each, once again creating an opportunity for arbitrageurs.\n\n### A Possible Scenario by Doing Nothing\nAs of the time of writing this proposal, Noun NFTs have already been acquired by arbitrageurs (the user who won #854 has a history of past forks [Link to Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x67DaCc258DCCc8CbFB493c652ab5170C3CFf0AD9#nfttransfers)). With one Noun generated daily, there's a possibility of arbitrageurs putting in winning bids with an intention of liquidating Nouns, similar to the previous fork.\n\nWithout taking corrective action,  the on-chain voting mechanism of Nouns suggests that the faction expecting liquidation will likely vote against all proposals. Their aim is to prevent a reduction in the treasury wallet's amount for the next 100 to 200 days, which will lead to a stagnation in NounsDAO's operations ([This blog](https://mirror.xyz/cfeng.eth/8j9FljMPp2COKLovoHF6j9P1I_lSP-xzSh8QM8cw1iE) also provides insights into the impact of the forking mechanism on floor prices).\n\n\nTherefore, we believe it's imperative to deliberate and implement appropriate measures before arbitrageurs potentially take control of NounsDAO.\n\n### NFT Auctions as Fundraising\nWhat’s the purpose of NFT auctions in NounsDAO?\n\nFor Nouns in its current state, setting aside its operational reality, it essentially boils down to conducting daily \"fundraising\" much like a startup. NounsDAO is raising funds from visionary individuals and pioneering companies worldwide, who anticipate the \"future of a full-fledged DAO,\" at the brisk pace of one auction for a Noun per day.\n\nDuring periods of high demand and enthusiasm for NFTs and cryptocurrencies, this daily pace may have been suitable for maintaining a balance between supply and demand. However, with the NFT market now experiencing the trough of disillusionment and diminishing expectations, continuing at this same fundraising pace carries the risk of entering a negative cycle, ultimately making NounsDAO vulnerable to arbitrageurs.\n\n\n## Solution\n\n### Consensus on the Future of NounsDAO\nWith the first fork period finished, NounsDAO needs to establish consensus across the entire DAO on the following matters and modify the format of NFT auctions to better suit the current circumstances. \n\n1. Continuing NFT issuance is equal to \"fundraising,” from a financial perspective.\n2. When the market is experiencing a downturn or lacks corresponding business revenue, the “NFT floor price” calculated from the market capitalization will decrease. or if there is no accompanying business revenue model, the \"NFT floor price\" derived from the market capitalization will decrease.\n3. As the \"NFT floor price\" decreases, the risk of being targeted by strategic arbitrageurs will rise again.\n4. Post-fork, NounsDAO still possesses a substantial reserve of 13,000 ETH for ongoing operations.\n5. **Implement a change in the NFT auction format to completely eliminate external pressure from arbitrageurs (this is our proposal).**\n6. Advance discussions to create a more effective fundraising mechanism for NounsDAO.\n\n### Detailed Proposal Explanation\nWe will now provide a thorough explanation of the proposed changes:\n\nBy updating the `NounsAuctionHouse` contract, we aim to add a dynamic minimum reserve price for the auction. This minimum bid will be set at **a value equal to or greater than the current pro-rata share of a single noun**. The value will be calculated by the formula below.\n\n**minimum bid price = the treasury amount at the start of the auction / the number of remaining Nouns NFTs**\n\nAlso the treasury amount will be the total sum of ETH, stETH, and USDC held by the DAO.\n\ne.g., the minimum bid price as of writing this proposal would be 35.09ETH = 13,547 (ETH) / 386 \n\nBy determining a minimum bid based on the Treasury amount, it will not be possible to make purchases below the average Treasury amount, as is currently the case with auctions at around 20 ETH.\n\nIf no bids are placed above the minimum reserve price, the Nouns NFTs will be burned. The total number of NounsNFTs and the total amount of treasury will remain the same, effectively having the same effect as if the auction had been stopped (i.e., preventing arbitrager purchases).\n\nIn cases where bids surpass the minimum reserve price, the user with the highest bid will receive the Nouns NFT, just as they did in current auctions. Since the winning bid exceeds the pro-rata share, it will increase the value of each Noun NFT. This influx of new users, who are not arbitrageurs, will stimulate the healthy growth of NounsDAO and elevate the value of Nouns NFTs.\n\n### Anticipated Scenario with the Implementation of Minimum Reserve Price\nBased on recent auction prices, it is expected that there will be a limited number of users willing to bid above the current pro-rata share of a single noun. Consequently, there will likely be a period of standstill in the auctions, with no notable increase in new NFT holders.\n\nOn a positive note, funding Nounish proposals from the treasury will still be viable, without concerns about arbitrageurs. This allows for a smooth processing of Nouns proposals as usual.\n\nGiven that it's shortly after the fork, it's presumed that not many arbitrageurs are left in the DAO. This, in turn, will enhance the intrinsic value of Nouns IP, and active funding for Nounish proposals will be made possible.\n\nMoreover, with proactive funding, the overall amount in the treasury will gradually decrease, resulting in a reduction of the minimum reserve price. This, in turn, will attract new Nouns holders.\n\nThe post-fork challenge for NounsDAO lies in elevating the quality of proposals and exploring more effective ways to utilize the funds. With the introduction of the minimum reserve price based on the treasury, it becomes imperative to increase the number of users bidding above the average treasury amount to acquire new Nouns holders. Therefore, it's crucial to take an active approach to using the treasury funds.\n\n## Summary\nThis proposal may seem like a passive attempt to preserve the assets in the treasury. However, considering the current situation where there is an economic threat from external sources (arbitrageurs), it is natural to consider measures to prevent the stagnation of DAO activities and to eliminate external pressure for survival.\n\nFurthermore, this proposal serves to clarify the original purpose of utilizing Nouns' treasury for Nounish proposals, rather than for the profit of arbitrageurs.\n\nDecision-making for funding in a DAO is a complex matter, and while NounsDAO's structure shows promise, there is still room for improvement.\n\nWe believe that advancing discussions for creating a more effective funding mechanism for NounsDAO, all while mitigating external pressure from arbitrageurs, is a positive step forward.",

          "description": "# Sensuality in Art: Proposal for Funding a Transformative Project\n\nThe tone of the project will be one of inclusivity, respect, and open-mindedness. Our objective is to establish a new branch within the DAO, a more mature and secure space where artists can freely express their interpretations of nounish in art space. Simultaneously, we encourage the DAO to approach this topic with an open heart and mind. By promoting dialogue and understanding, we aim to challenge preconceived notions and nurture a more mature, accepting, and diverse community.\n\n\n\n**Note:** The project's creators have chosen to maintain their anonymity, prioritizing a focus on the project's message and artistic vision rather than individual recognition. \n\n\n\n# First Shot : Sensuality\n\n**Introduction:** In the world of art, sensuality has always played a vital role in evoking emotions, pushing societal boundaries, and expanding creative horizons. This proposal aims to investigate the profound connection between sensuality and art, while seeking funding for a project that celebrates and explores sensuality in various forms. By delving into this captivating topic, we aspire to craft a thought-provoking experience that visually engages and inspires the community. \nKeywords: Sensuality, art, community.\n\n**Body:**\n\nThe proposed project aims to create seven immersive art pieces, each representing different expressions of sensuality applied to characteristic nouns, corresponding to the seven days of the week. By collaborating with four esteemed photography artists, our goal is to craft a visual experience that celebrates sensuality and its richness.\n\nThese pieces will be thoughtfully curated to explore various facets of sensuality, including its ties to human emotions and the natural world. Through meticulously designed works of art, we aim to prompt viewers to contemplate their own perceptions of sensuality and challenge societal norms surrounding this often-misunderstood concept.\n\nTo ensure the success of this project, we are seeking funding to cover several aspects, including artist fees, additional incentives, production, and the care of these pieces. By securing the necessary funds, we can provide artists and staff with the resources they require to create impactful and thought-provoking artworks.\n\nFurthermore, this project aspires to extend beyond its initial phase. Future plans include organizing more immersive and expressive materials, enabling viewers to engage visually and musically.\n\n\n\n**Rise of Sensuality:**\n\nSensuality, often considered taboo in many cultures, holds delicate curves and unique identity within the body. Art, in its purest form, serves as a means of self-expression for the body, a visual language.\n\nAllow me to introduce one of the guest artists - [Guido](https://x.com/guidodisalle), a renowned name in photography, known for his aesthetic sensibilities and indescribable visual prowess.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/k4RMWal.jpeg)\n\n[Guido Di Salle's](https://www.flowcode.com/page/guido)\n\n**Minting and Distribution**\n\nOut of the seven pieces produced, only two will be made available for minting as limited editions, created by our invited artists. Details will be provided on each guest artist's profile when unveiling their piece.\n\n**Cost:** 7E to cover team expenses, provide additional incentives, and compensate the artists + 4 NounsVision to be sent to invited artists.\n\n**Conclusion:** In conclusion, this project seeks to explore the captivating intersection of sensuality and art through an immersive experience that can enrich our cultural understanding and initiate a new community. With secured funding, we can embark on a journey with talented artists to create a transformative experience, challenging societal norms and celebrating diverse expressions of nounish in the world of art.",

Born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Bob has not only transformed the skateboarding landscape but has also left an indelible mark on global culture. Gifting Noun 542, adorned with a skateboard head, to this skateboarding maestro would be a fitting tribute to his legacy.\n\n## 💥 Cultural Impact\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeifoecnwfhetsm3zpkw5342ai6v4lckbo2xmo7nkww45idczou6mfy)\n\n▶️ *[Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=wlL4NPOrYck) to watch the above video*\n\nBob's influence transcends skateboarding.

His Dreamland series, which showcased his private skatepark, was a testament to his creativity and became a viral sensation. His stunts, especially the heart-stopping Grand Canyon jump, have been broadcasted worldwide, further cementing his status as a skateboarding superstar.\n\n\n## 💸 Charitable Endeavours\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeia4t4k2zg6g3ptxxdfisowu7reisskj4rr5jm6jmq2njj7xbqpmwi)\n\nBob's heart is as big as his talent. Through his institutes and foundations, he has consistently worked towards the betterment of society. From promoting skateboarding among underprivileged kids to championing environmental causes, his philanthropic efforts are commendable.\n\n## 🫂 Nounish Contributions\n\nBob's engagement with the NFT world and Nouns DAO is not just as an icon but as an active contributor. As a partner at **NFT Brasil**, he's at the forefront of integrating the vibrant city of São Paulo into the NFT landscape, with a robust collaboration planned in the coming year. \n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreigxcco4jkqhbtj6kphjirdxgmno3cdwv7u5tohu2yc2ftseipdz6a)\n\nHis social program, **Skate Cuida**, is a testament to his commitment to community upliftment. Through this initiative, he's been onboarding individuals into the world of technology, offering programming classes, and witnessing transformative progress.

It would be a celebration of a legend, an acknowledgment of his contributions, and a testament to the indomitable spirit of skateboarding. We'd be embarking on a quest of serendipity together, where the potential for collaboration is boundless.\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreicn34ghkmznkjyfn7zhbnyni73hwfmldaqhthpqivpi7frksopu2e)\n\nBob's committed to repping Noun 542 and participating in governance, as both a voter and nounish builder. His creativity and groundbreaking track record are testament to what he could, and already does, bring to Nouns. If there are times where his full focus is needed elsewhere, there's ample opportunity for thoughtful representation through delegation, either by his team, vast network with deep industry experience, or as part of educational endeavours at his institute. \n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeideeb4fbkn2i3s37fmq5tnkzr3krmi5l4wyza7sx7a2tcchkwddge)\n\n▶️ *[Click here](https://www.voxels.com/play?coords=E@1007E,1112N) to visit to Bob's Voxels property (got a tour on our most recent call)* \n\nI've followed Bob's career since I was a child, and as an amateur skateboarder, I'm thrilled to have even met him, let alone be collaborating with him directly. Gnars has taken me on such an incredible journey and Nouns has made it all possible. It's a wonderful feeling to come full circle and present an opportunity such as this one to the community I hold so dear. Can't wait for everyone to see what Bob's been cooking.\n\n🔥 *Here's to Season 3 and the future of Nouns!*\n\n*[Gami](https://gami.wtf)*",

          "description": "# Aburra (fka Alphacaster): Nouns x Farcaster\n\nTL;DR: Requesting 24 ETH for Aburra (formerly Alphacaster) to explore the frontier of Nouns x Farcaster and build a best-in-class web3 social app for the next 3 months. Payment via steaming.\n\n\n### Overview\n\nFarcaster represents a unique opportunity to decentralize Nouns communication and bring Nounishness to more onchain organizations.\n\nAt Aburra, we have been building at the intersection of Nouns and Farcaster since early 2023 and have won Nouns Hack Week for our MVP v1 in April.\n\nToday, Aburra has evolved significantly since its v1. In addition to being both a Nouns client and a Farcaster client, it allows anyone to host Farcaster spaces where listeners can directly vote for proposals.\n\n![Aburra iOS](https://i.imgur.com/Fm3kQS3.png)\n\n\nOur ambition is not just to create the best Nouns client, but to make all DAOs more Nounish by helping them communicate on top of an open and permissionless protocol (i.e. Farcaster).\n\nWe also hope to use this prop to see what is possible when you combine two of the best web3 ecosystems - we want to push towards a future where open communication protocol is favored over Discord and Twitter.\n\n\n\n### What Aburra has delivered so far\n\n**Applications developed**\n- [Alphacaster.xyz](https://Alphacaster.xyz) and WebView-based mobile apps ([iOS](https://testflight.apple.com/join/JLPtu4r8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.alphacaster.app) - to be combined with the new app): DAO-specific Farcaster feed, governance notifications, enhanced proposal pages with cast-based comments etc.\n- A proposal bot ([@alphabot](https://warpcast.com/alphabot)) to convert all props, votes, auctions and propdates into casts\n- Beta Aburra app ([iOS](https://testflight.apple.com/join/uLiAhdUA) and web): Been testing it for two weeks and it now supports Farcaster space with native DAO integrations (proposal and voting)\n\n![Nounish Emoji Reactions in Aburra](https://i.imgur.com/RQCt0fz.jpg)\n\n**Current traction**\n- Aburra has become the default way for Farcaster users to consume proposals and votes. In the last 30 days, it had 3.9K unique visitors. It also has Warpcast [integrations](https://warpcast.com/dwr.eth/0x3cec05).\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oT7WtK7.png)\n\n- Since we started testing the new app in early Sep, we've hosted 9 Farcaster spaces for Nouns, Purple and Nouns Builder. 80 users have installed the [app](https://testflight.apple.com/join/uLiAhdUA). More Nounish spaces are in [the](https://warpcast.com/aburra) [pipeline](https://warpcast.com/toadyhawk.eth/0x64bd48).\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rXUDxAX.png)\n\n### Plan for the next 3 months\n- Full integration with Farcaster channels, including reading Nouns channel directly in\nthe app (and in any space)\n- Phase out the old Alphacaster app and merge all functionality into Aburra: this\nincludes implementing everything (governance feed, proposal pages etc.) natively,\ninstead of using WebView, which will significantly improve UX\n- Better space UX, with native DAO features (NFT minting, droposal, smoother voting etc.)\n- Integrate with more Nounish DAOs (and others!)\n- Launch Android\n\n### Team\n\nAburra has 2 full-time team members, billzh.eth ([@billzh](https://warpcast.com/billzh) on FC) and blingbling.eth ([@16](https://warpcast.com/16) on FC). Both of us are experienced developers and have built production-grade consumer applications.\n\nSo far we have received 12.9 ETH grants from Nouns Builder ([9 ETH](https://www.alphacaster.xyz/dao/BuilderDAO/prop/48)), Nouns Hack Week ([3 ETH](https://prop.house/nouns/hack-week-developers-developers-developers/5256)) and Warpcast ([~0.9 ETH](https://warpcast.com/v/0xd74872)).\n\n\n### Ask\n\nThe ask is 24 ETH (0.2% of current treasury) to help us continue to build Aburra for the next 3 months. That is, 8 ETH per month for a team of two.\n\nThe team is lean and we are confident to deliver a top-tier application with significantly lower cost than comparable clients (House of Nouns at [95](https://nouns.wtf/vote/242) ETH, Agora at [220](https://nouns.wtf/vote/154) ETH and Prop Lot at [60](https://nouns.wtf/vote/244) ETH).",

It serves two goals of providing upside incentive that is missing currently (you're not financially incentivized to do well beyond just delivering the prop) along with providing a retrospective feedback moment that we can all learn from (all prop builders are incentivized to give good [prop updates](https://www.propdates.wtf/) since they want to win; nouns voters end up expressing onchain what props they value).\n\nThe last time we had a really concrete conversation around doing retroactive rewards for props was [this conversation](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-build-retro-house-retroactive-reward-house/1810/13). Yitong (pre-Agora) suggested leading this effort. It was well received as an idea but at the time we thought Prop House would ultimately handle retro rewards as well and decided to table implementation. Unfortunately, we got super side-tracked as a community and never really got to implementing something here. \n\nSeason 3 is when we should finally make this happen. I suggest we have the prize be nouns since we now have a good amount in the treasury post-fork and because it feels right that nouns are also earnable in the world building game that is nouns beyond just only being up for purchase.\n\nAnother motivation is to reduce the burden of prop builders having to make the [awkward ask](https://www.nounsagora.com/proposals/371) of including nouns in their props. I would much rather it be proactively clear that if your prop is one of the best props of the quarter, you'll be getting a noun even without having made such negotiation ahead of funding.",

          "description": "# The Smallest Noggles Ever Made: A Micro-Sculpture by Dr. Willard Wigan MBE\n\nUpdate (9/27/23):\n\nAppreciate the interest Noun 40 and Brennen!  Responding to your feedback below:\n- The micro-sculpture will simply be the Noggles in the middle of the eye of a needle. For this, it will take me about 9 weeks to create as I work on multiple projects at the same time.\n- I’ve removed the part on highlighting 3 Nouns for sponsoring.\n- Updated cost: 45 ETH. I will build this at-cost (microsculpture + Nouns-themed microscope display) and all proceeds will go to me - none to my foundation.\n\nVery excited for this opportunity. Would love to get started on this as soon as possible!\n\n--\n\nHi all, my name is [Dr. Willard Wigan MBE](https://youtu.be/zh5BMEyfmCI?feature=shared). I’m a [micro-sculpturist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YOdH2wqL9M) and I hold the record for creating the [world’s smallest sculpture](https://www.willardwiganmbe.com/world-records). \n\n![hello](https://i.imgur.com/KEcTQNg.png)\n![youtube](https://i.imgur.com/1afCMCC.png)\n\nGrowing up for me was a little hard. I wasn’t too good at reading or writing as my autism and dyslexia made it incredibly difficult. Luckily, I was able to discover my hidden talent for creating small sculptures and since then I’ve achieved things I never thought I could. \n\nThis brings me to Nouns - I love how you all support the creative arts with your treasury. My [foundation](https://www.thewiganfoundation.com/) is heavily focused on helping the youth to find FAAIR - Focus, Awe, Ambition, Inspiration, Resilience. Many of the projects and people in your community reflect the ideals that I strive to instill in the youth and that gets me excited to make this proposal to you all.\n\nFor this proposal, I want to turn the Noggles into one of my signature micro-sculptures. This will take me 9~ weeks to create. When I finish the sculpture, I will encase it in acrylic and place it in a custom Nouns-themed microscope display box. \n\n![tiny](https://i.imgur.com/ZeWpibE.png)\n\nTo make these sculptures, I hold my breath to slow down my heart rate and chisel in-between my heartbeats. Sometimes I use the tremors caused by my heartbeat to jackhammer the material. Much like how the Nouns are sculpting an infinite art piece with every onchain proposal, every vote and every Noun created every day.\n\nI’m requesting 45 ETH to bring the Noggles micro-sculpture to life.

He’s a fatalistic struggling music artist just trying to make it. Everyday Ed B faces a new challenge – having to fight off racists at Trader Joes while perusing the vegan aisle, or running butt ass naked for a couple of dollars to pay his rent, OR having to sell photos of himself on the internet to help fund his next record – BUT they never stop him from pushing towards his dream of becoming the Beyoncé of puppets.\n\n## FORMAT\n\n* 10-12 minute web(3)isode\n* Stop motion and mixed media animation.\n\n___\n![](https://imgur.com/aah6X7X.jpg)\n# Pilot Episode\n\n## SYNOPSIS\n\n“A Song About Black Love” - Infatuated by a blossoming love interest, Ed B works out a new song about the joys of Black love. Billy, Ed’s bandmate, roommate and white ally, questions a hidden secret within Ed’s relationship and mayhem ensues.\n\n## FUNDING\n\n“A Song About Black Love” was self funded by Ed Balloon in 2022 primarily through the sale of NFTs. The tentpole fundraising project was the Run Ed Collection, a first-of-its-kind generative sound and motion NFT project that blended stop-motion, 2D and 3D animation, and music. Ed Balloon dropped the 1000 piece collection and it sold out, kickstarting production of the pilot. To help uplift other artists, Ed Balloon pledged 50 percent of the collection’s secondary sales toward The Ed Balloon Generational Wealth Fund, which collects work from Black and other under-represented artists in Web3.\n\n## CAST\n\n**Ed B “The Puppet”** | Ed Balloon\n**Billy** | Seth Green (Robot Chicken, Family Guy)\n**Peggy** | Blair Socci (Comedian)\n**Savannah** | Destiny Lavigne\n___\n# Nouns Integration in New Episodes\n\nThe possibilities for Nouns integration within the Ed B The Puppet universe are infinite. Noggles can be introduced as unique accessories that Ed and Billy can interact with, enabling them to solve problems or embark on new adventures. Noun characters could even make an appearance, bringing a sense of curiosity, wonder, or even magical qualities to the narrative.\n\n___\n![](https://imgur.com/Rw9HCbF.jpg)\n# Project Objective\n\n## Amplify Diversity\n\nBy creating content that celebrates and embraces diversity, we can showcase a wide array of perspectives and experiences. The Ed B ‘The Puppet’ Show will feature characters from different backgrounds, challenging stereotypes and fostering empathy among audiences. Through collaboration with the Nouns, we aim to elevate the visibility of diverse voices and promote a more inclusive entertainment landscape.\n\n## Utilize Satire for Social Commentary\n\nSatire serves as a powerful tool for social commentary, allowing us to address pertinent societal issues in a thought-provoking and engaging manner. By employing satire, we can challenge the status quo, stimulate critical thinking, and spark conversations that lead to positive change. Our collaboration with the Nouns will provide a platform for satirical content that encourages viewers to question and reconsider established norms.\n\n## Promote Collaboration and Solidarity\n\nOur project embraces the spirit of collaboration within the web3 community. By partnering with the Nouns, we aim to showcase the power of collaboration in amplifying diverse voices and driving innovation. Through cross-platform promotions, joint marketing initiatives, and immersive fan experiences, we can create a unified front that promotes solidarity within the industry. We will be using noun features (Noggles, characters, etc) in these episodes.\n\n___\n![](https://imgur.com/LGpjxXz.jpg)\n# Creative Team\n\n## Ed Balloon [Series Creator & Creative Director]\n\nSpearheading cultural representation and identity through his music and digital art, Ed Balloon has solidified himself not only as a Web3 artist and musician but also as a community leader.  Known for his innovative approach to music making, dynamic production style, and unique blend of electronic, hip-hop, and R&B, his 2022 Run Ed collection was presented as a one-of-a-kind generative sound and motion endeavor that blended stop-motion, 2D and 3D animation, and music. To help uplift other artists, 50 percent of the collection’s secondary sales continued to go toward The Ed Balloon Generational Wealth Fund, which collects work from Black and other under-represented artists in Web3. The pioneering musician also recently self-funded through the sale of NFTs the stop motion animated satire \"A SONG ABOUT BLACK LOVE.”  Executive produced by Daveed Diggs and starring Ed alongside actor Seth Green, the film showcases the difficulties of finding love as a black puppet.  Ed was also recently nominated to nftnow's NFT100, a celebration of the top 100 influential creators and community leaders in the NFT space.\n\nTwitter: @Ed_Balloon\n\n## Daveed Diggs [Executive Producer]\n* Vocalist in experimental hip hop group Clipping.\n* Co-star in The Little Mermaid, Hamilton, Snowpiercer, Wonder, Velvet Buzzsaw\n* Writer and Producer of Blindspotting\n* Tony and Grammy Winner.

          "description": "# Hyper-Meta-Proposal: Crafting a New Primitive in Noun Redistribution\n\n## TL;DR\n\nIn an orthogonal pivot from the mundane, I am offering a meta-proposal that isn’t just a proposal but an avant-garde interpretation of skeuomorphic designs – melding the old with the new primitive. Requesting 699 ETH, this initiative aims to merge traditional aesthetics with innovative mechanics, requiring not just any builders, but those versed in both the tangible and the meta.\n\n### HyperObjectives:\n\n1. **Orthogonal Meta-Proposal Crafting:** A layered, multifaceted approach to crafting a proposal for allocating 100 nouns, ensuring every facet interlinks in an inter-meta way.\n2. **Integration of Skeuomorphic Design:** Embracing the tactile, traditional designs and integrating them into our modern, digital framework. A digital-physical meta-melding.\n3. **Engage Esoteric Builders:** Those who understand the nuanced dance between the new primitive and conventional constructs.\n\n### HyperBudget:\n\n1. **Skeuomorphic Meta-Design Integration - 299 ETH:**  \n   A harmonious integration of the tangible and the intangible, this allocation will facilitate a design so vivid and tactile, it virtually reaches out through the screens. The fund ensures a meticulous exploration and integration of skeuomorphic principles, proliferating the meme of tactile digitalism, and initiating a wave of hyperproliferation in design thinking within the space.\n\n2. **Engagement of the best Builders in the space - 250 ETH:**  \n   Sourcing only the paramount builders fluent in the languages of the meta, the orthogonal, and the skeuomorphic. This allocation is not merely a compensation; it’s an investment into minds capable of weaving the fabric of the new primitive into our meta-construct. It’s about creating a virtuous circle where every builder’s insight amplifies the project’s esoteric resonance.\n\n3. **Orthogonal Research & Development - 100 ETH:**  \n   Venturing into uncharted territories requires a sidestep from the conventional – an orthogonal approach. This allocation is destined for exploring the avenues less traversed, dissecting the meta’s essence, and ensuring its seamless fusion with the tangible, thereby contributing to the hyperproliferation of innovative methodologies and a sustained virtuous circle of knowledge.\n\n4. **Miscellaneous Meta-Expenses - 50 ETH:**  \n   For every meta-journey, there are intricacies unseen and costs unforeseen. This allocation is a prudent reserve for those intangible elements and serendipitous requirements that pop up in the meta-space, ensuring the smooth progression of our skeuomorphic odyssey.\n\n### HyperTimeline:\n\n1. **Month 1-2:**  \n   A period dedicated to the meticulous engagement of builders — not just any builders, but those with a refined appreciation for the skeuomorphic and a deep understanding of the new primitive. Their insights will be the cornerstone of our journey.\n\n2. **Month 3-4:**  \n   Embarking on a path of orthogonal research, dissecting and understanding the essence of meta. This period is about melding the intangible with the tangible, exploring the unseen, and laying down the foundational elements for our skeuomorphic integration.\n\n3. **Month 5-6:**  \n   The crafting phase of the meta-proposal. Every detail, every nuance will be explored, examined, and refined, ensuring that what emerges is not just functionally sound but esoterically profound. It’s about proliferating the meme and contributing to the virtuous circle of esoteric design.\n\n4. **Month 7:**  \n   Final refinements, addressing any miscellaneous meta-expenses, and presenting a proposal that stands as both a functional masterpiece and a work of art in the meta-construct space.\n\n### HyperConclusion:\n\nThis isn’t just a proposal; it’s a meta-journey through the hypercorridors of the skeuomorphic, the new primitive, and the orthogonal. With a mere 699 ETH, we will redefine the paradigms of NounDAO, architecting a proposal that is as tangible as it is meta. We beckon the NounsDAO community to endorse this adventure, marrying the meta with the material.",

          "description": "# DAOpunks: A retroactive Nounish DAO for the CryptoPunks community\n\n# DAOpunks\n*tl;dr - A generalized protocol to \"Nounsify\" any existing NFT collection, starting with the CryptoPunks community in the form of a Punker DAO*\n\n![DAOpunks Landing Page Preivew](https://imgur.com/oJlSew2)\n\n**Mainnet Launch:** Today, Sept 26th, 2023\n**Website:** [daopunks.wtf](https://daopunks.wtf)\n**Twitter:** [@daopunks](https://twitter.com/cdaopunks)\n**Discord:** [join](https://discord.gg/daopunks)\n\n# Nounsifying an Existing Collection\n\nWe believe (i) the Nouns model is the most innovative and sustainable model for NFTs to date, and (ii) it should be made available to retrofit any existing collection.\n\nThus, we forked Nouns DAO and added 3 new features:\n\n1. **Attribute rarity** - attributes can be rendered in the daily artwork based on weighted probabilities.\n2. **Duplication prevention** - a registry is used to index the attributes of existing NFTs, which prevents the `NSeeder.sol` contract from ever creating any repeat artwork.\n3. **Treasury co-ownership** - two collections are permitted to co-govern the DAO treasury: the new, Nouns-based collection plus an additional, existing collection.\n\nThese three features allow any community of an existing NFT collection to \"Nounsify\" themselves by introducing new artwork and a continuous source of collective revenue.\n\n# Scope\n1. We've taken this protocol and developed it for the CryptoPunks community first: \n\n    i. **Attribute rarity** - one new DAO Punk will be generated per day. The rarity of attributes will be approximately the same as CryptoPunks.\n    ii. **Duplication Prevention** - we indexed all 10,000 CryptoPunks. No DAO Punks will ever be a duplicate of a CryptoPunk. Once a DAO Punk is minted, it is added to the index to prevent its own duplication.\n    iii. **Treasury co-ownership** - One CryptoPunk = 1 vote. One DAO Punk = 1 vote.\n\n2. This protocol will be generalized in partnership with [Zora](https://twitter.com/ourZORA) and [Builder DAO](https://nouns.build/dao/ethereum/0xdf9b7d26c8fc806b1ae6273684556761ff02d422/265) via [Nouns Builder](https://twitter.com/nounsbuilder) to create a ***Collections+*** protocol for any existing NFT community to \"Nounsify\" itself.\n\n# Why start with CryptoPunks?\nCryptoPunks is the [largest NFT collection by market cap](https://nftpricefloor.com/?sort=ranking&dir=asc), but is communally, completely cash poor. CryptoPunks were released by [Larva Labs](https://www.larvalabs.com/) on June 23rd, 2017 with a free mint price and zero trading fees. As a result, no community funds were ever accumulated, and Punk holders are unable to do any of the cool things Nouns holders get to do today.\n\nBecause CryptoPunk holders are so high profile, yet financially incapacitated, they are particularly susceptible to adopt a retrofitted, self-sustaining mechanism, like Nouns. This provides an especially high probability of success with this experiment.\n\nIf we can demonstrate a successful execution of the Nouns protocol for the CryptoPunks community, it will serve as an inspiration for all other prominent (but potentially nascent) NFT collections to Nounsify themselves, too. The success of a DAOpunks collection could easily become one of the largest proliferators of the Nouns ethos, while simultaneously catalyzing widespread NFT coordination and market sentiment for select and willing communities.\n\n# Request\n\n* 100 ETH transferred to seed the Nounsified DAO treasury for the CryptoPunks + DAOpunks community, collectively known as the Punkers DAO.\n\n## Reasoning\n\nThe request is effectively structured as a 100 ETH delegation to the owners of all CryptoPunks in exchange for them adopting the Nouns model and distributing funds with comparable intent (and vibes).\n\nSimilar to Zora's [proposal #167](https://nouns.wtf/vote/167), we are requesting that NounsDAO pay it forward rather than reimburse us for:\n\n* approximately 50 ETH worth of development we paid out of our own pocket.\n* 12 months of time we spent independently researching, developing, and fine tuning the first  *Collections+* implementation.\n\nWe do not want reimbursement, we want proliferation!\n\n## Deliverables\n\nIn return for seeding 100 ETH into the Punker DAO, we will (or have already):\n\n* Deploy the implementation for the CryptoPunks community to mainnet\n* Open source the codebase of this first Collections+ implementation\n* Open source the research we conducted on CryptoPunks in building this project\n* Open source the research we've begun for other collections\n* Generalize the protocol in partnership with Zora & Builder DAO via Nouns Builder\n* Steward the Punker DAO initiatives & community\n\n## Generalizing the Protocol\n\n> \"If I had to suggest only one short term focus after L2 it would be funding and generalizing the Punks+ work by [@cr](https://warpcast.com/cr). Show up to the website and start a canon DAO for any existing project.\"\n>`-` [Jacob Horne](https://twitter.com/js_horne), Founder of Zora ^[https://warpcast.com/jacob/0xabeab6] ([see also](https://warpcast.com/jacob/0xd00662))\n\nCryptoPunks are dramatically different than other NFT collections:\n\n* They do not use the ERC721 standard - they use ERC20\n* They have multiple, mutually exclusive sub-classes of traits\n    * *Example: `{hair, hat}` are in the same sub-class*\n* They have single-attribute (non-class based) rules of exclusion\n    * *Example: `welding goggles` are `glasses` that can be worn with `hair` but not with a `hat`*\n* They have multiple visual implementations of the same attribute\n    * *Example: `vr glasses` have 2 different pixel patterns depending on if the punk is `female` or not*\n\nThese unique characteristics, which are not found in other collections, required us to create a lot of custom logic. As a result, our codebase is not yet immediately generalizable.\n\nTo achieve a generalizable state, we will work in cooperation with Zora and Builder DAO to port our architecture into their Nouns Builder protocol, which is already extremely accessible and widely adopted. This port will allow any NFT community to deploy their own Nounified DAO using Zora's intuitive, no-code tools.\n\n# Team\n* I am [CBob.eth](https://twitter.com/CBobRobison), founder of [meTokens](https://twitter.com/metokens) and former [Hoard](https://twitter.com/hoardexchange), [Golem Foundation](https://twitter.com/GolemFoundation), and OMG Network team member.

Open source and CC0, it's essentially what you make it. Now we've made Droposals the norm, and have [drop focused clients](https://nouns.wtf/vote/346) on the way, it's time we had our own media house onchain. \n\nInspired by the Factory Records [catalog](https://www.metalabel.xyz/magazine/features/five-creative-lessons-from-factory-records), I am proposing an ERC1155 contract to which we can mint individual editions as part of a dedicated NFT collection that grows with us. To instantiate the Nouns Media House collection, a F\\(R\\)EE open edition, forever. \n\n[ZORA Protocol Rewards](https://support.zora.co/en/articles/8192123-understanding-protocol-rewards-on-zora), for this first token only, will be directed to an immutable 50/50 [0xSplits contract](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0x600FE23Ba14066B7aD85575624a46d9A6C56cCeF/) between the Nouns treasury and `gami.eth` as a reward for the idea. All successive mints would be created by the DAO executor through Droposals and since we've already established 50/50 splits with creators as [the norm](https://nouns.wtf/vote/236), even splits between each creator and the DAO are likely to continue.  \n\nA new meta is upon us that's [Free + Valuable](https://twitter.com/js_horne/status/1703979364713451653) so let's make our releases more accessible, so they can proliferate further, while also monetising them atop ZORA's exciting new innovations.\n\n## Release details\n\n**Token name:** ⌐◨-◨\n**Description:** One Noun, Every Day, Forever.\n**URI:** ipfs://bafkreicuf4zbr76mf7jor7qungb62es7mija6amkmm26xy5r5lbb7cmm5y\n\n**Collection:** Nouns Media House\n**Description:** An official Nouns release catalog.\n**Edition size:** Open Edition\n\n**Price:** 0 ETH\n**Mint limit:** Unlimited\n**Mint start:** Now\n**Duration:** Forever\n\n**Link to mint:** [⌐◨-◨.to/mh-one](https://xn----vpoz1kba.to/mh-one) (will be redirected once live)\n\n*NOTE: Default admin will be set temporarily to `gami.eth` to update the custom payout address for token 1 only, as pictured below, and changed to Nouns treasury once everything is confirmed to be working as expected. Tenderly has been used to [simulate](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/gami/project/simulator/5e2be6cf-4404-41f0-bf81-32295d60e63b) the attached transaction successfully.

          "description": "# Proposal for Fire Safety, Community Recognition, and Commemorative Initiatives\n\n## Summary\nThis proposal is an urgent plea for the allocation of 370 ETH and 20 Nouns to acquire a fire truck and implement associated measures aimed at protecting our valuable assets, particularly the Treasury, and ensuring the safety of our builders. Given the possibility that the treasury might actually be set on fire, we need to take immediate and comprehensive steps to mitigate risks, safeguard our builders, and manage the potential fallout effectively.\n\n## Objectives\n- Safety of Builders: Prioritize the safety of our esteemed builders who are integral to the progress and innovation within our ecosystem.\n- Asset Protection: Acquire a fire truck to address the tangible risk of fire and protect our assets.\n- Risk Mitigation: Secure an insurance policy to cover potential damages and losses.\nReputation Management: Hire a PR firm to manage communications and mitigate any reputational impact.\n\n## Budget Allocation\nThe total ask for this proposal is 370 ETH and 20 Nouns, allocated as follows:\n\n- Fire Truck Acquisition: 80 ETH\nPurchase of a fire truck equipped with the necessary firefighting apparatus.\n- Operational and Maintenance Costs: 20 ETH\nCover operational costs, including fuel and maintenance, for one year.\n- Training and Certification: 10 ETH\nComprehensive training for designated personnel, focusing on the safety of builders.\n- Insurance Policy: 40 ETH\nPurchase of a comprehensive insurance policy to cover potential damages and losses.\n- PR Firm Engagement: 50 ETH\nHiring of a reputable PR firm to manage communications and reputational risk.\n- Gremplin Artwork on Fire Truck: 10 ETH\nCommission Gremplin to hand-paint Noggles on the fire truck, adding a unique touch to our safety equipment.\n- Fire Resistant Noggles by Klim: 20 ETH\nCollaborate with Klim to manufacture special fire-resistant Noggles for the firefighters.\n- Bravery Recognition: 20 Nouns\nAward 20 Nouns to the brave firefighters who put their lives on the line for our community.\n- Commemorative Blockspace by Dead Address: 30 ETH\nSecure blockspace for headstones in the dead address to memorialize any Nouns lost in potential incidents.\n- Commemorative Episode by TNS: 20 ETH\nSponsor TNS to create a special episode celebrating the achievements and contributions of the Nouns DAO community.\n- Nouns on the Ground: 40 ETH\nProvide funding to send Nouns on the Ground on a well-deserved holiday to Bora Bora Island as a token of appreciation for their contributions.\n\n## Implementation Plan\n- Acquisition and Customization: Procure the fire truck promptly and collaborate with Gremplin for the artistic customization.\n- Safety Gear and Recognition: Work closely with Klim for the production of fire-resistant Noggles and organize recognition events for our firefighters.\n- Memorialization and Celebration: Arrange for the commemorative blockspace and collaborate with TNS for the celebratory episode.\n- Rejuvenation: Facilitate a rejuvenating holiday arrangement for some of our most esteemed proliferators.\n\n## Benefits to Nouns DAO\n- Enhanced Safety: Proactive measures ensure the safety of our builders and the protection of our assets.\n- Community Morale Boost: Celebratory and commemorative initiatives foster a sense of unity and appreciation within the community.\n- Reputation Assurance: Effective communication and reputation management strategies uphold the image of Nouns DAO.\n- Reflection and Gratitude: Memorialization and appreciation initiatives cultivate a culture of reflection and gratitude.\n\n## Conclusion\nBy allocating 370 ETH and 20 Nouns, we can implement a comprehensive set of measures and initiatives to enhance safety, celebrate our community, honor bravery, and reflect on our collective journey. This proposal represents a balanced approach to addressing immediate safety concerns while also fostering community spirit and appreciation.\n\nNote: In case the treasury survives and the fire truck is not needed any excess funds will be used to purchase Moonbeans which will be sent to starving children in Africa.",

[NDJ's Prop House](https://prop.house/nouns-japan)  has been a cornerstone of our growth and community engagement. However, we have noticed a decline in activity since our last round, Round-10. Consequently, this issue has been concerned many of us who see the immense potential in our local community.\n\nOne Major hurdle is the language barrier. Many Prop House events are in English, limiting the participation of our largely Japanese-speaking community.\n\nTo address this gap, we would like to kindly request your financial support to re-launch and sustain our Prop House for a period of one year. We believe this will boost Nouns DAO's brand awareness in Japan and create valuable content. We'll also look for self-funding options during this period. \n\n**Total ask: 18 ETH**.\n- Rewards: 0.5 ETH * 5 props * 6 times = 15ETH\n- Operations & Public Relations: 1 ETH/year * 3 persons = 3 ETH\n\n# What is Nouns DAO Japan\nPokemon, Hello Kitty, Anpanman, Super Mario, Dragon Ball, One Piece, Naruto, etc... Japan is home to iconic characters and boasts a rich culture of derivative works and cosply. This cibrant creative scene serves as fertile ground for talented creators. \n\nNouns DAO Japan (NDJ) is the largest Nouns community in Japan with approximately 3,300 members. Various creators, mainly Japanese, participate in NDJ and enjoy creating secondary Nouns works while engaging in friendly competition.\n\n\nThe following is a corner of the creativity from NDJ.\n## Nouns New Parts Creation\n ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H14J-ArJT.png)\n The beluga created by [amiyoko](https://twitter.com/amiyoko_eth) on the left was adopted for [Anniversary Art 2023](https://nouns.wtf/vote/348).\n\n## Nouns Base\n![](https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/c878d0a2d11b92ce308d9b403855ce35.gif)\nNouns secondary production created by [KURAN](https://twitter.com/KURAN_Nouns). A secret base to build with friends.\n\n## And more\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJHbi0Sk6.png)\nMany creators gather at NDJ to create fascinating works of art!\n\n\n# Why should Nouns DAO invest in the Prop House of Japan\nJapanese creators have uniquely blended local culture with NounsDAO's vision, generating captivating content. However, activity has slowed since Prop House Funding ceased after Round-10.\n\nVarious communities are holding Prop House, but unfortunately, only a limited number of Japanese are able to participate in other Prop House because of their poor English skills.\n\nIt is a great loss for Nouns DAO that during this time, talented creators from the character powerhouse of Japan are leaving Nouns DAO.\n\n# Prop House Recipients of Support\nHere are some of the achievements supported by NDJ's Prop House.\n## Nouns National Baton Relay ([Round-1](https://prop.house/nouns-japan/round-1/653))\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJssgkIyT.png)\nThe baton relay is actually handed over in the real world as “Noggles = Baton\".　This initiative will increase loyalty to the Nouns DAO by directly connecting people who love Nouns with each other in Japan.\n\n## pNouns ([Round-5](https://prop.house/nouns-japan/round-5/2027))\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1O-5WwJT.png)\n\n[pNouns](https://pnouns.wtf/en/) is an experimental project that has the potential to fundamentally change the social structure with ”real NFT” and ”real DAO”. We are going to become a member of Nouns DAO, recognized ”real DAO” and propose a project to the pooled 35 million treasury.\n\n## Ethereum Navi ([Round-5,6,7](https://prop.house/nouns-japan/round-5/1949))\n[Ethereumnavi](https://ethereumnavi.com/tag/nouns/) specializes in cutting-edge Crypto native NFT projects, Web3 development information such as Solidity, and other information around Ethereum.\nThe platform features accessible articles on Nouns, significantly contributing to the project's expansion in Japan.\n\n## UNouns ([Round-6](https://prop.house/nouns-japan/round-6/2540))\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bk83oQD16.png)\n\n[UNouns](https://unouns.wtf/) = Nouns doing United Nations.

After that, we will consider our own ongoing measures.\n\n**Expand community:** Attract new participants to NDJ and increase credibility and awareness of Nouns DAO in Japan.\n\n# Operations\n### Hosting Of Prop House\nlead: [Eiba](https://twitter.com/eiba8884)\n- Prop house will be held every 2 months.\n- Set up a reward of 0.5 ETH*5 from the funds donated.\n- Giveaway [NDJ PFP](https://opensea.io/collection/nouns-dao-japan-pfp) to the person who gets the most votes each time.\n- Voting right will be [POAP](https://opensea.io/collection/nounsdaojapanpoap) issued by Nouns DAO Japan once every six months.\n### Public Relations\nleads: [Takumi](https://twitter.com/Okirakukai) & [Daynao](https://twitter.com/daynao_daynao)\n- Regular space will be held daily. This space has been running for more than a year and is growing Nouns DAO Japan's core fan base.\n\n# The Future\nNouns DAO Japan is considering next steps after receiving one year of assistance.\n\nThe first candidate is **JPNouns**.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1-EwILya.png)\n\nNouns holding auction & treasury system from \"Japan\" was adopted in [Round-9](https://prop.house/nouns-japan/round-9/5482). It is still in the planning stage, but it is a measure to spread the Nouns in Japan, separate from Prop house.\n\nThe evolution of Nouns DAO in just a year has been remarkable, and we anticipate even more transformative changes ahead.

          "description": "# Elect 24 Nouns \"Gardeners\" as the Voting Body for Nouns' Prop House Open Rounds\n\n## TLDR\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1WFfT30n.png)\n\nLet's kickstart the Prop House (PH) open rounds again by branding them as the \"Nouns Garden\" (to make them more fun and memeable) and run a mandated PH round to elect 24 \"Gardeners\" to vote on the DAO's behalf in these rounds.\n\n_Note: This prop was ideated by Noun 40 and was developed in collaboration with seneca. Artwork was created by [Facu](https://twitter.com/facuserif)._\n\n---\n\n## Context\n\nEarly in Nouns' history, PH open rounds served an important role within the Nouns ecosystem. It was a place where new builders could receive a few ETH for their early to mid stage ideas with less governance overhead. It was also a way for the DAO to create open competition around a not-too-big commitment of ETH spending, and allow the DAO to harvest the long-tail of ideas rather than being limited to what makes it onchain.\n\nHowever, over the rounds, voter attention waned and PH open rounds started to show its governance weakness. Unlike onchain props where every large voter ultimately paid attention to every prop and voted when necessary, PH open rounds started to go largely unattended. What's worse, rounds increasingly ran the risk of being arbitrarily determined by whichever large voter decided to engage in a given round.\n\nAs a result, the PH open rounds lost much of its legitimacy and we were unable to continue funding through it. Towards the end, we were running 2.5 ETH single-winner rounds every other week, funding a grand total of 5 ETH(!) per month through PH. The last round's outcome—[Open Round 21](https://prop.house/nouns/open-round-21)—was determined by a single large voter as the sole voter of the winning prop.\n\n---\n\n## Proposal\n\nLet's kickstart the PH open rounds again branding them as the \"Nouns Garden\" (to make them more fun and memeable) and run a mandated PH round to elect 24 \"Gardeners\" to vote on the DAO's behalf in these rounds.\n\nRepresentative voting should allow for a more attentive class of voters to vote on each open round while the election ensures that the DAO voters still indirectly maintain influence over the outcomes of PH open rounds. \n\n## More details:\n\n**The Art:**\nThe gardener art work was completed by [Facu](https://twitter.com/facuserif) and funded using PH team's funds.\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJyrigaCn.png)\n\n\n**Minting & Distribution:**\nThis proposal mints 24 Nouns Gardener NFTs initially going to the [garden-admin multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xD94F65a9BFa4Fcb04FFbc0A64687667FcB28110e) managed by Noun 40 and seneca. If this prop goes through, the PH team will run the Gardener election mandate round. The winners will then be sent the Gardener NFTs which will serve as the voting token in the Nouns Garden rounds. \n\n\n**Gardener Selection:**\nThe Gardener position should be open to nouners and non-nouners alike and everyone that's interested in having fun doing civic service for the dao is welcome to run for the position!\n\nIt's desirable that the PH layer doesn't end up with an entirely disjoint set of voters from the onchain prop voters. Ideally, there's a lot of overlap and as a result the props that win funding at the PH layer will have a good chance of success receiving continued funding onchain if they continue to execute well.\n\nThe Gardener position will be re-elected at a 3 month cadence. 6 months or a year feels like forever in Nouns time. 2 months feels too frequent.\n\n**Gardener Compensation:**\nThe Gardener position will be volunteer roles without specific compensation (outside of the NFTs!)\n\nThere's a notion that delegate positions should be paid b/c reading props and voting is \"work\". However, not all civic service positions are better performed when paid, and there's also definitely fun and prestige in serving as a PH delegate of the DAO. This proposal intends to explore the potential of representative voting at the PH layer without adding financial incentives into the mix.\n\n**Gardener Voting Power:**\nEach Gardener will have the equal voting power (10 votes to spread across props in each round). If we start to observe bad behavior amongst Gardenders such as collusion or self-dealing, then we could institute quadratic voting where the cost of voting for the same prop multiple times goes up linearly such that it is harder to effectuate collusion or self-dealing. We're proposing to start with the simple voting scheme so that we don't unnecessarily introduce complexity.\n\n**Gardener Count:**\n24 was chosen as a size that is materially larger than committee sizes we explored in the past with NSFW (4-10) and DCS pod (5), as to assuage the concern (or perception) that a few people can be influenced to sway outcomes, while also ensuring that the Gardener election is likely to be competitive. It is not hard to imagine that we can elect two dozen worthy candidates. It is not clear that we could elect fifty. \n\n**Garden Rounds:**\nNouns Garden rounds will start off as 5 ETH x 2 winners (10 ETH) rounds every other week. \n\nTwo 10 ETH rounds a month still amounts to a very small percentage of our overall funding allocated through PH open rounds. We spent around ~900 ETH per month the past year, so 20 ETH would be ~2% of our spending rate. Ideally, the open-ended, lower friction, competitive, mid-tail funding the PH open rounds promise can scale further to be 10-20% of our spending, but we likely shouldn't start where we want to end up. We should scale up as builders return to PH and rounds remain competitive even as more funding goes through.\n\nOnce the PH protocol is launched, the DAO could vote on these parameters concretely. For now, we have to trust the PH team to execute these rounds.\n\n**Garden Funding:**\nNouns DAO has granted the Prop House team a total of 550 ETH over the last 2 years to direct towards Nouns DAO related rounds of which 160 ETH remain. These funds will be used towards the first quarter of Nouns Garden (60 ETH).\n\n**Miscellaneous:**\nIf the Nouns Garden is successful and continues after the first quarter, each quarter we will mint new Gardener NFTs such that Gardeners can continue to own their old NFTs as an object that holds provenance of their service. We would not expect Gardeners to transfer or sell their NFTs to someone else before the quarter is over given their reputation is at stake.",

Eg. 3 ETH for first meetup, followed by a 5 month stream of 15 ETH, or 3 ETH per month, to continue facilitating meetups, for a 6 month experiment (per host) in total.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThere's so many Nounsfolk residing in different cities around the world. Since the early bitcoin days, meetups have helped people gather around emerging crypto movements. Nouns should be no different, so let's exploit the full feature set of candidate proposals, and source hosts for  in their cities.\n\n## People among Places doing Things\n\nWe've all come to appreciate the power of IRL events, but until recently, we've focused mostly on top-down gatherings. I'm proposing a grassroots movement of intimate local meetups of Nounsfolk around the world. Each host would be streamed 3 ETH per month for facilitating such, with 1.5 ETH as remuneration and the remaining 1.5 ETH for expenses. \n\n## One Meet, Every Month, Forever\n\nI can imagine discussions around Web3 evolving into in-person Prop House pitches, Nounish hackathons, builder support groups, and some epic brainstorming sessions. If genuine grassroots movements begin to emerge from various cities around the world, we'd be fine tuning our serendipity machine with a breadth of healthy competition. Facilitators would be encouraged to source and host other builders from outside the Nouniverse and do their best to record, document, and broadcast panel discussions, AMA sessions, workshops, and whatever else they can dream up.\n\n## Nouns Meetup Sydney\n\nI'd like to request 3 ETH to host an inaugural meetup alongside [SXSW Sydney](https://sxswsydney.com/) during 15-22 October 2023. Followed by a 3 ETH monthly stream starting 1 November 2023, for a trial period of 5 months (a total of 6 months if you include the pilot event). To make the absolute most of what candidate proposals have to offer, I'd also like to invite pre-proposal feedback, including nominations for whoever else is interested in hosting a monthly Nouns Meetup in their city.\n\n## Lets Meet?\n\nOpt-ins from 12 locations for example, would cost us 36 ETH per month over 6 months, for a total of 216 ETH. As nominations are received and interest is confirmed, this proposal can be edited with nominee details and associated transactions, prior to being sponsored and going onchain for voting.\n\nShall we call it in?\n\n[Gami](https://gami.wtf)\n\n*Note: there's a bug with stream setup, so have omitted from attached transactions, and it can be added later during further iterations of this candidate proposal. Details have been sent to developers.*\n\n*Update: Ripe has shipped a Pull Request to address the above issue.*",

          "description": "# 1 ETH Test: Stacking Treasury Yield With Origin Ether\n\n![OETH Graphic](https://imageupload.io/ib/7wHXLUdXjhsKHYD_1695230412.png)\n\n**TL;DR**: \n\nI am Peter from the Origin Protocol core team. This is a proposal for a (very) low-risk test to earn yield for the Nouns treasury by utilizing Origin Ether ([OETH](https://oeth.com/)). Converting 1 ETH into 1 OETH (they are 1:1) for 30 days would act as a case study to test that Nouns can safely earn high risk-adjusted yields for the treasury by utilizing OETH. \n\nOrigin Protocol is an OG team that launched in 2017. We launched OETH about 4 months ago, with the goal of making it possible for retail users to earn the same kind of yields that institutional traders earn, without needing millions of dollars and a full-fledged trading team. OETH deploys collateral to blue-chip protocols, distributing the yield back to holders daily via positive rebase. Current OETH yield is 8.01% APY on ETH, or about 2x that of the largest LSTs. \n\nWe have seen much larger test case props to Nouns ([Prop 320 for example](https://nouns.wtf/vote/320)); in our opinion this is much too large of an amount to test a new technology with, which is why we are proposing to begin with a 1 OETH test, and can submit an additional proposal in the future for an increased amount as the Nouns community becomes more familiar with OETH. \n\nThis proposal will include two transactions: the first to convert 1 ETH into 1 OETH, and the second to opt the Nouns wallet in for yield generation.\n\nA more detailed overview on the proposal and on how OETH works can be found below. \n\n![OETH Graphic](https://imageupload.io/ib/3Uu8NmrrBr6axiU_1695230390.png)\n\n## Stacking Treasury Yield With OETH\n\nPrevious Relevant Proposals:\n18 - [Stake 1 eth in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/18)\n22 - [Stake 10% of treasury in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/22)\n30 - [Stake additional 10% of treasury in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/30)\n52 - [Increase Treasury stETH Position to ~20%](https://nouns.wtf/vote/52)\n217 - [Stake additional 5000 ETH in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/217)\n227 - [Stake additional 5000 ETH in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/227)\n313 - [stETH peg protection](https://nouns.wtf/vote/313)\n320 - [Treasury Diversification](https://nouns.wtf/vote/320)\n\n**Summary**: \n\nThis is a proposal to convert 1 ETH into 1 Origin Ether ([OETH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/origin-ether)) to test OETH yield generation for the Nouns treasury.\n\n**Abstract**:\n\nThis is a low-risk test to increase the yield of the Nouns treasury ETH/stETH from 0-4% to 8-10% utilizing Origin Ether (OETH). Converting 1 ETH into 1 OETH for 30 days would form a similar hypothesis as proposal 18 - in this case, that Nouns can safely stack yields utilizing OETH. \n\n**Motivation**:\n\nFrom proposals 18, 22, 30, 52, 217, and 227, it is clear that the Nouns DAO was interested in earning yield on the treasury and extending the project runway. Proposal 313 signals that the community would prefer to continue earning yield with stETH, instead of eliminating risk completely and converting entirely back to ETH. Proposal 320 signals that other mainnet LSTs can be useful for treasury diversification. \n\nThe OETH TVL has been trending upwards at a rate of about $1m per day since launch and has been crushing it in comparison to direct competitors with the yield we are generating. OETH yield is currently at 8.01% APY, whereas icETH APY is down to 2.94% and Cian stETH strategy is down to 4.02% despite taking leverage.\n\nWe are proposing to begin with 1 OETH, and can submit an additional proposal in the future to increase the amount as the community becomes more familiar with OETH. OETH provides significantly increased yields while also protecting against centralization and slashing events. \n\n\n## OETH Overview\n\nOrigin Ether was launched in May 2023 and is an ERC20 LST aggregator that generates blue chip yield while sitting in your wallet. OETH is backed 1:1 by stETH, rETH, frxETH, ETH, and WETH at all times; holders can go in and out of OETH as they please. Similar to stETH, OETH yield is paid out daily and automatically (sometimes multiple times per day) through a positive rebase in the form of additional OETH, proportional to the amount of OETH held.\n\nOETH yield, currently ~8.00% APY, comes from a combination of:\n\n1. Deploying ETH/WETH on Curve, Convex, and Morpho\n2. LST validator rewards\n3. A 50bip exit fee is charged to those who choose to exit OETH via the [dapp](https://app.oeth.com/) (completely avoidable if using a DEX), this fee goes back to OETH holders\n4. OETH sitting in non-upgradable smart contracts does not rebase, instead the interest generated from those tokens is provided to those that can rebase\n\nThese 4 yield generating functions combined enable OETH to generate higher yields than holding or farming any single LST manually. The current collateral allocation and yield strategies can be seen on-chain at all times via the [OETH analytics page](https://www.oeth.com/analytics). Future OETH collateral and yield strategies are governed by [OGV stakers](https://governance.ousd.com/stake).\n\nObtaining OETH is seamless, anyone can convert from ETH, stETH, rETH, or frxETH into OETH via any of the following methods:\n\n- Minting on [OETH.com](https://app.oeth.com/)\n- Swapping on [Curve](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-298/deposit)\n- Swapping on [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x856c4efb76c1d1ae02e20ceb03a2a6a08b0b8dc3&outputCurrency=ETH)\n- Swapping on [Maverick](https://app.mav.xyz/pool?chain=1&tokenA=0x856c4efb76c1d1ae02e20ceb03a2a6a08b0b8dc3&tokenB=0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2&fee=0.0004&width=0.001) \n- Swapping on [Sushiswap](https://app.sushi.com/swap?inputCurrency=ETH&outputCurrency=0x856c4Efb76C1D1AE02e20CEB03A2A6a08b0b8dC3&chainId=1)\n\nFor this proposal, Nouns will be using [The Zapper](https://docs.oeth.com/core-concepts/the-zapper) to convert the 1 ETH into 1 OETH. A second transaction will also be included to ensure the Nouns wallet is [opted-in for yield generation](https://docs.oeth.com/core-concepts/elastic-supply/rebasing-and-smart-contracts). \n\n**Benefits of Using OETH**\n\nThere are a few reasons for why Nouns would choose to use OETH over of attempting to use the same yield strategies: \n\n- The yield will always be higher with OETH than if you were to use any of the same yield strategies, since not all OETH is opted-in for yield, and because of the exit fee. At the moment 23,731 OETH is collecting yield and 21,280 is not, so Nouns would receive this boost in yield from the OETH opted-out. With the exit fee Nouns would get paid each time there's an exit - occasionally this puts the combined yield into the 100s!\n\n- The Curve/Convex strategy would be very difficult (if not impossible) to replicate without having a Curve pool with a gauge + millions in TVL - Nouns would essentially need its own token and voting power and would be competing for yield with the other large flywheel token holders. \n\n- If Nouns were to do the same strategies, someone would need to manage the position. The OETH protocol would be that manager, with collateral reallocated among the whitelisted yield strategies each week. \n\n- The OETH protocol chases not just the highest yields but also the safest. During the weekend of March 10 when USDC and DAI depegged, it took the OUSD strategists/Origin engineers about 4 minutes to notice the depeg, and 16 minutes to start the process of moving the funds to a safer strategy. $0 were lost! \n\n- The OETH protocol covers all gas costs for moving funds between yield strategies, which is happening weekly but eventually will happen daily. With the price of gas on Ethereum, this could get costly for Nouns if Nouns were to follow the same reallocation schedule. \n\n- The cost for security - Origin has OpenZeppelin on retainer! Every new OETH contract is audited before going live. OETH security is prioritized over new feature development. The same level of security would cost Nouns millions of dollars in audit and development costs. \n\n- Top-notch development team - OETH shares 95% of the same code as OUSD, which has been live on mainnet for more than 3 years - longer than the Nouns DAO! The battle-tested code that has seen almost $400m combined has been and continues to be developed by a team of 10 full-time engineers. This level of talent required to maintain the smart contracts would be extremely expensive for Nouns, if Nouns were to try and replicate the OETH strategies. \n\n\n## Usage of Funds Generated\n\nSince launch, OETH has earned a yield of about 2x that of stETH yield. With the extra yield generated for the Nouns treasury, there are several avenues for using the additional funds:\n\n- Subsidizing public goods spend - Nouns traditionally spends ~800 ETH per month on public goods\n- Subsidizing Nouns marketing - this would offset the cost for future Nouns movies, paid promotions, conference expenses, swag, and Noggles \n- Subsidizing Nouns infrastructure and auction expenses \n- Subsidizing cost for collaboration with other projects - Pudgy Penguins is just the beginning! \n- Funding large team efforts for less - it would take 50% of the stETH yield to fund another Nounish or Agora sized team effort\n- Extended DAO runway - Nouns would extend the project runway twice as long\n\n\n**Community Cases for Increased Yield**\n\nI also don't think getting to our eth position to 100% staked eth limits our spending in any way… the ~500 ETH additional yield we'll get from staking the 10k ETH is not nothing. It's being able to fund another ~$1M / year sized team. That's like being able to fund another nounish or agora sized team effort, which is meaningful! - *Noun40*\n\nI think the DAO should maintain around ~6mo of operating spend as ETH… diversify into other staking providers to reduce concentration risk. Overall in agreement with staking more ETH to increase runway. - *cfeng.eth*\n\nThe income generated from holding stETH also amounts to ~500 ETH / yr, which is more than 2 weeks of auctions. - *noun12.eth*\n\nstETH is a better way of holding eth - *fugazi.eth*\n\nI believe there is already too much of the treasury being staked in Lido. I am not interested in staking more, and if I were, I would want to use some other protocol that isn't Lido since we already have a lot in Lido. - *onnnnnnnion.eth*\n\n\n\n## Potential Risks and Mitigation\n\nThere are six possible risks when using OETH, and Origin is making sure to reduce each risk as much as possible:\n\n*New token risk* - Given OETH is a relatively new token, some may be worried that OETH is prone to new attack surfaces. While this may be true for other new tokens, OETH was built reusing 95% of the OUSD code, of which 10+ audits have been done since 2020. Not that long ago, [OUSD reached a market cap of $300m](https://defillama.com/protocol/origin-dollar) without breaking, and without diminishing the APY it was capable of generating. Origin continues to work on OUSD, despite the lower market cap.\n\n*Counterparty risk* - OETH is governed by OGV stakeholders around the world. Everything from yield generation to fee collection and distribution is managed by a set of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. These contracts are upgradeable with a timelock and are controlled by hundreds of governance token holders. While the initial contracts and yield-earning strategies were developed by the Origin team, anyone can shape the future of OETH by creating or voting on proposals, submitting new strategies, or contributing code improvements. We intend for all important decisions to be made through community governance and limited powers to be delegated to trusted contributors who are more actively involved in the day-to-day management of the protocol.\n\n*Smart contract risk of the yield strategies* - Origin is only using platforms for yield generation that have a proven track record, have been audited, have billions in TVL, maintain a bug bounty program, and provide over-collateralized loans. Over-collateralization in itself, combined with liquidations, provides a reasonable level of security for lenders.\n\n*Collateral risk* - Origin has chosen 3 of the largest LSTs to ever exist to back OETH, and they have maintained their peg quite well since launch. They have also demonstrated significant growth in circulating supply, so the Origin team is confident that the 3 LSTs will maintain their peg and that OETH will remain stable to ETH. To ensure accurate pricing at all times, OETH is using Chainlink oracles for pricing data for rETH and stETH, and a dual oracle for frxETH that combines two sources: the Curve frxETH/ETH EMA oracle and the Uniswap frxETH/FRAX TWAP oracle. In situations where any OETH collateral falls below peg, [OIP-4 disables minting](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin-dollar/issues/1000) of additional OETH tokens using the de-pegged asset.\n\n*Slashing risk* - Since OETH is collateralized by multiple LSTs at the same time, OETH is protected from slashing from any individual collateral LST. If there is a small slash, the OETH yield will simply decrease, as income will likely exceed the size of the slash. During a major slashing event, both the slashed LST and OETH will experience a drop in value relative to ETH, but OETH should not fall as low and for as long as the slashed LST, as the remaining un-slashed OETH LSTs will soften the blow. There will never be a negative OETH rebase.\n\n*Smart contract risk of OETH* - Origin is taking every step possible to be proactive and lessen the chance of losing funds. Security reviews are prioritized over new feature development, with regular audits being done, and multiple engineers are required to review each code change with a detailed checklist. There are timelocks before protocol upgrades are launched, and deep dives into the exploits of other protocols are constantly being done to make sure the same exploits don’t exist on Origin contracts. Security is extremely important to the Origin team. OETH was built reusing 95% of the OUSD code, of which 10+ audits have been done since 2020. All audits can be seen on [Audits - OETH](https://docs.oeth.com/security-and-risks/audits) , and OpenZeppelin is now on retainer. On-chain insurance protocol InsurAce awarded OETH and OUSD the [highest possible security rating of AAA](https://app.insurace.io/coverage/buycovers), of which only 3 other projects on the InsurAce platform have received. Optional OETH cover is currently available for both OETH and OUSD on InsurAce. Origin Defi also maintains a $1m bug bounty through [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/explore/), with a resolution time of 7 hours. \n\n\nExternal OETH analysis:\n\n[Llama Risk](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/asset-risk-assessment-origin-ether) - Asset Risk Assessment: Origin Ether (OETH)\n[Auxo](https://mirror.xyz/auxo.eth/1NXxHhJmj44EfHmvA5pEH7mpSLtg-CbYRqmuEkaTRRk) - OETH - Protocol Analysis\n\n\nOETH in the news:\n\n[Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/16/origin-protocol-enters-competitive-ether-yield-market-with-oeth-offering/) - Origin Protocol Enters Competitive Ether Yield Market With OETH Offering \n[TokenInsight](https://tokeninsight.com/en/news/origin-protocol-launches-yield-aggregating-eth-derivative-called-oeth) - Origin Protocol Launches Yield Aggregating $ETH Derivative Called $OETH \n[Blockster](https://blockster.com/maximize-eth-staking-yields-with-oeth-a-yield-bearing-ether-pegged-token-by-origin-protocol) - Maximize ETH Staking Yields with OETH: A Yield-Bearing, Ether-Pegged Token by Origin Protocol \n\n**Closing Thoughts**\n\nPeter is a core member of [Origin Protocol](https://originprotocol.com/) and is joined by the fully doxxed Origin team and community, which includes hundreds of thousands of members and open-source contributors. Many members of the Origin team, including both founders, are holding a significant portion of their personal wealth in OETH. Origin Protocol’s corporate treasury is also holding millions of dollars in OETH. We have skin in the game and are willing to put our own money at risk with the code we have written.\n\nThere are no lockups with this proposal, Nouns can move in and out of OETH as the Nouncil, core team, DAO, and community desires. OETH remains completely liquid at all times, and can be spent in the same way as its backing collateral, if unexpected expenses were to arise.\n\n",

We’re so close to the triple but weren’t able to land one on our exhibition day in Utah. \n\nIn this candidate, we’re asking for an extension to continue our work towards breaking this world record. With this prop, we will be able to work for 3 more months - taking our learnings and doubling down on the things that are working. We will be focusing more on perfecting the triple rotation and plan on making a week long trip to BMX legend Ryan William’s mega ramp in Australia where we believe we will get enough air time for Wheelz to do a triple.\n\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/PEscmiI.jpg)\n[Here is Ryan’s mega ramp and him nailing a bmx triple backflip on it](https://youtu.be/G-jXjLA4OYg?t=300)\n\nRyan's ramp has all of the elements that will make this triple possible - a longer runway and a ramp with more pop compared to the ramp we used in Utah will give Wheelz more air time to get those 3 rotations. We're confident that this ramp will be where the world record will be broken.\n\nWhen the triple is landed, our plan is to combine Part 1 and the footage from Australia to create a 15-18 min documentary which will be released on all socials. We also plan on working with Guinness Book of World Records to have our footage of the triple proliferated through their socials as well.\n\nMessage for @dorculas (ex-Noun 64): \nWheelz is an absolute force and spending this time with him made me realize that he embodies so many more nounish qualities than I first thought. He’s an incredible creative builder and puts every ounce of his energy into the wheelchairs he makes. He’s a man for the people and seeing him interact with the kids at Woodward was such a delight. And he’s relentless in his pursuit to bring something that has never been seen in this world. I have full confidence in his ability to nail this trick and I hope you all can help us see this through.\n\n**The Ask**\n\n- **The First Triple Back Flip in a Wheelchair**\n    - Wheelz (3 month extension) - $45,000\n    - Ramp Rental, Ramp Marketing Materials - $15,000\n    - Transportation, accommodations, admin - $5,000\n- **Content Team**\n    - An epic “Part 2” documentary featuring Wheelz (2 shooters, 1 audio, 1 editor) - $20,000\n    - Transportation, accommodations, admin - $7,500\n\n**Total - $92,500 USDC**",

But now it is leading a global movement that it has pioneered. They accept crypto as a form of payment in their e-commerce, have tokenized experiences, have a metaverse, and see this new market as a point of differentiation.

We are seeking funding to expand our actions in three complementary strategic directions:\n\n1) New regions 📍\n2) Proper marketing in Brazil 🇧🇷\n3) New product categories 👀\n\n**1) New regions 📍**\n‎ \n![](https://i.imgur.com/4iKllzi.png)\n‎ \nNarcose is already part of a network of regular collaborative breweries, through which it markets its beers in the US and Europe. We will take Public Good Beer to these markets, also integrating them into our onboarding ecosystem and turning them into real Nouns builders.\n\nWe are asking for 4350 USDC for label printing, marketing material, initial beer production (minimum 1500 cans/bottles), and aftermovies/content production FOR EACH of our partners:\n\n**Canil** (Portugal) 🇵🇹 - already committed to 1500 bottles and will launch in October, ahead of various crypto events such as ZKdevsummit, Dune Con, ETH Lisbon, EBS2023, Nearcon and Web Summit, all happening in November.\n\n**Stillwater Brewery** (Seattle) 🇺🇸\n**Against the Grain** (Kentucky) 🇺🇸\n**Wooden Ship** (Minneapolis) 🇺🇸\n**Brewski** (Sweden) 🇸🇪\n**Bierol** (Austria) 🇦🇹\n\nIf breweries exclusively produce the subsidized batch, Nouns' maximum cost per can or bottle, which includes premium beer, label printing, a launch event, and ongoing marketing and sales throughout the batch, is only 2.90 USD. Should the brewery opt for a larger batch, as is the case in Brazil, or produce a second batch independently, this cost significantly decreases.\n\nAdditionally, the impact of the funding goes beyond a single event. It serves as a **catalyst for wider influence and regular integration of Nouns into everyday culture.** This is evident in the growing number of [reviews](https://untappd.com/b/cervejaria-narcose-public-good-ipa/5389905) on the popular Untappd app (over 70 to date), spontaneous shares on social media, adoption by various Gnars-related activities in Brazil, featuring in the Nounish Punk game, and our successful production management in Portugal.\n\n👉 **Accelerating Public Good Beer expansion not only brings legitimacy but also sustains a lasting cultural impact for Nouns.**\n\n**BUDGET: 6x 4350 = 26100 USDC**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jvG8dTb.png)\n‎ \n**2) Proper marketing in Brazil 🇧🇷**\n‎ \nInternational expansion will not be instantaneous, as it demands a free schedule in the industry. In this period, we take advantage of the remaining inventory of over 3000 cans produced. \n\nDespite the success of Phase 1, we believe we haven’t reached the full IRL proliferation potential for such a pioneer project. We had 0.5 ETH for everything (sub-300 cans and a very short-scale marketing activation). Thus, the proposed expansion would bring the deserved impact and tons of resources for further promotion of the Nouniverse.\n\nWe are requesting 4350 USDC per quarter for the next six months to fund the activities below. We commit to at least one IRL event every quarter, but given the rapid growth of the Nouns community in Brazil, we anticipate numerous opportunities to engage with new fans.\n\n- Public Good Beer distribution\n- Marketing materials (shirts, stickers, temporary tattoos, and more)\n- Brand activations\n- Professional media production\n\n**BUDGET: 2x 4350 = 8700 USDC**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5JpkcCz.gif)\n‎\n**3) New product categories 👀**\n‎ \nBeyond beer, we have the opportunity to extend the portfolio to two synergic brands/categories:\n\na) BBQ sauces - for the weekly beer-fueled barbecues we do in Brazil; and\nb) Sunscreen - for our community along 7637 km of coastline, with bikinis, surf stars, and sunglasses ⌐◨-◨ \n\nWe would like to allocate a total budget of 5000 USDC for working on this as the project progresses. Alongside this, we also have the coordination and maintenance of the activities during the period of six months at a cost of 6000 USDC.\n\n**BUDGET: 11000 USDC**\n‎ \n## Roadmap\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/S9KqgmZ.png)\n‎ \n## Team\n\nfabioseva.eth\njp.⌐◨-◨ \n\nWe are very excited to keep spreading the cc0 culture and bringing companies on board with us. A huge shoutout and heartfelt thanks to everyone who's supporting the project, either by engaging online or drinking the beer IRL. Don't forget to follow [@PublicGoodBeer](https://twitter.com/publicgoodbeer) on Twitter for all the latest updates. Cheers to a future of collaboration and doing good!\n‎ \n## Budget\n\n**45800 USDC (~ 28 ETH)**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LHIh5Aw.gif)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HUBuh7p.gif)\n\n*Sponsor's Note: (ccarella.eth)*\n\n*As an enthusiast for Public Goods, I am thrilled to sponsor this proposal onchain. It's incredibly satisfying to witness a tangible representation of the Public Goods brand. With its CC0 recipe, distinctive branding, and collaboration with various breweries, this project stands out as an innovative venture that extends the reach of the meme. It also encourages people to contemplate the importance of both CC0 and Public Goods.*",

In Nounish DAO fashion, 1 daily NFT = 1 vote,  will determine NFTR funding initiatives. In return for the funding, Nouns DAO will receive 10% of the supply in perpetuity. In addition, NFTR will direct 5% of daily auction proceeds to the Nouns DAO treasury up to 80 ETH.\n\nNFTR allows naming any ERC-721 with a globally unique name across all Ethereum.\n\nNFTR DAO will eternally proliferate Nouns as sponsor of the NFT Naming standard. \n\nThe up and coming standard -- [ERC-6551](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6551)’s Token-Bound Accounts turn NFTs into active onchain identities that can do anything an EOA / smart contract wallet can do. Active NFTs and their accounts need human-readable names for reference and reach.\n\nThis initiative expands Nouns’ addressable market to **all NFT holders**.\n\n# Who's Behind NFTR?\n\n[DigitalOil](https://x.com/0xdigitaloil) is the founder and CEO of [NFTR](https://nftr.name). Team includes 1 BD lead, COO, 2 more devs, and a designer. Development began in Q3 2021. Before going full-time web3, DigitalOil was an iOS developer, satcom engineer, and logistics business executive. He was behind [Prop 199](https://nouns.wtf/vote/199) and worked on [Private Voting](https://prop.house/nouns/private-voting-research-sprint/3976) (recently won the Nouns Private Voting contest) Research funded by Nouns. DigitalOil also recently founded [The Panama DAO](https://twitter.com/ThePanamaDAO), in the image of Nouns DAO, which was pre-seeded 1 ETH by [Nouns Prop House](https://prop.house/nouns/open-round:-12/2166) and subsequently seeded 20 ETH by a [Builder DAO Incubator round](https://prop.house/builder/dao-incubator-round-2).\n\nFor more on DigitalOil’s thoughts about Nouns, please refer to his Nouns Agora statement.\n\nNote that DigitalOil has fronted all NFTR founding expenses (over $400k worth) since inception, ~19 months ago. NFTR has never raised seed funding.\n\n# What is NFTR?\n\nNFTR (NFT Registry) is a universal, permissionless NFT Naming Registry on Ethereum.\n\nNFTR allows naming any ERC721 with a globally unique name across all NFTs.\n\nIt's comparable (albeit different architecturally) to ENS for naming NFTs instead of wallets.\n \nNaming an NFT grants the NFT a NFTR Profile with soon to be integrated ERC-6551 functionality (a new standard for Token Bound Accounts) and extensive utility. \n\nNFTR provides an API so that any platform can pull and display names alongside NFTs.\n\nFor more details on protocol architecture, visit [NFTR.name](https://nftr.name) to view our [Docs](https://docs.nftr.name), try our live dApp, view NFTR Profiles at [name].NFTR.name, or engage on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/frMSHsAvay).\n\n![*Nouns that have been named on NFTR.

NFTR Profiles at [name].nftr.name facilitate and embed the following utilities (**bold** still under development):\n\n* Simple NFT reference + reach\n* Web3 verified links to socials + NFT marketplaces (showing best available price)\n* **ERC-6551 Integration (Token-Bound Accounts)**\n* **Subdomain per Token-Bound Account**\n* NFTR Name Marketplace (name trading)\n* **NFT Direct Messaging (between NFTs)**\n* Composability: New primitive for dApps to leverage\n* **Collection-native utilities and plugins into NFTR Profiles**\n\n![Verified socials (verified twitter handle shown). Allows for the first time for an NFT to point to a social media identity, inter-relating them both ways.](https://i.imgur.com/6zQ32bc.png)\n*Verified socials (verified twitter handle shown). Allows for the first time for an NFT to point to a social media identity, inter-relating them both ways.*\n\nIntegration of ERC-6551 features will operate a named NFT’s TBAs (Token-Bound Accounts) and associate them with a subdomain, making the TBA reachable by referring to the subdomain (e.g. banking.DigitalOil.nftr).\n\n![The NFTR Name Marketplace allows for trading NFT names.](https://i.imgur.com/UnUzHIP.png)\n*The NFTR Name Marketplace allows for trading NFT names.*\n\nAs an extension of an NFT's naming history, NFTR will develop the first NFT-event specific indexer. The indexer searches and detects all events related to an NFT, including:\n* Contract provenance\n* Mint date\n* Naming history\n* Wallet to wallet transfers\n* NFT enhancements / metadata changes\n* App specific events, like airdrop claims\n* Uses of the NFT as collateral\n* Using the NFT for some collection-specific utility (e.g. Mutating a BAYC)\n* Staking the NFT for yield\n* All of the above with the intent of making NFTR into the first NFT-centric identity platform, where NFTs become social and are front and center.\n\n# Why involve NounsDAO?\n\nDistributing ownership of the contracts and treasury of an Ethereum-wide primitive to a decentralized DAO is the ultimate proliferation of Nouns: perpetuating the ideal on-chain governance model.\n\nWe view Nouns as the purest instantiation of a DAO and are interested in adopting the Nouns DAO model for control and proliferation of the NFTR protocol.\n\nNFTR has been bootstrapped to date. A funding infusion will accelerate development at a critical time, facilitate NFTR’s first marketing efforts, and permit other initiatives to cement NFTR into its sensible role as a necessary and universally adopted public good. \n\nThe Nouns community is full of individuals concerned with innovation and the welfare of web3. We’d be honored to enlist your support and advocacy, both as a Nouns brand and as a collection of highly sensible and web3 native individuals. \n\n# ERC-6551 Integration + Enhancement\n\nFrom ERC-6551's [whitepaper](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6551#abstract):\n\nERC-6551 Abstract: “This proposal defines a system which assigns Ethereum accounts to all non-fungible tokens. These token bound accounts allow NFTs to own assets and interact with applications, without requiring changes to existing smart contracts or infrastructure.”\n\nAnother quote: \"Each token bound account is owned by a single ERC-721 token, allowing the token to interact with the blockchain, record transaction history, and own on-chain assets. Control of each token bound account is delegated to the owner of the ERC-721 token, allowing the owner to initiate on-chain actions on behalf of their token.\"\n\nIf ERC-721s (NFTs) are to be so active, they must be simply and uniquely identifiable.\n\nENS, fundamentally, provides this service to Ethereum wallets.\n\nNFTR, natively, provides this service to NFTs and ERC-6551 Users.\n\nAs ENS provides limitless value and utility beyond reach/reference, so does NFTR. \n\n# NFT Name Integration\n\nNFTR Names can be easily integrated by ABI/API call into:\n* Existing NFT Marketplaces (show names below NFTs for sale)\n* Metaverse spaces\n* Web3 Games\n* Social media apps that display verified NFTs\n\nIntegrated NFTR Names are:\n\n* Quickly reachable by web domain at [name].nftr.name\n* Clickable, directing to NFTR Profile for direct interaction with the NFT\n* Interactive via NFT Messaging, direct payments, bidding, browsing NFT history, etc.\n\n# How Does NFTR’s namespace work?\n\nNFT Names are registered in NFTR’s [Registry Contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc662a8ce36392d4b9489d0b59605a1874711bfc6). They are unique, meaning that no two NFTs can simultaneously hold the same name. They are NOT tokens or NFTs themselves. This brings the following benefits:\n* NFTR Name transactions are light (not gas intensive)\n* NFT Names are bound to the NFT, and travel with the NFT\nNFTR’s native name marketplace facilitates free in-wallet name transfer and buying/selling/bidding between wallets. Names are integrated into existing dApps via API/ABI call.\n\nNames are alphanumeric strings with no leading or trailing spaces, and are case sensitive for display purposes. But case-insensitive for duplicity purposes.\n\n\n# Similar Props\n\n**107 Verse**: Narrowly passed before funds were returned. Conflicted results due to purchase of equity in a non-Nouns project (Verse). Relation to our prop: NFTR is requesting DAO funds, not selling equity. NFTR is Nounish in DAO structure, and will feature ⌐◧-◧ in daily NFTs. \n\n**189 SharkDAO**: “I see these types of proposals as \"cultural venture investments\", similar to our @nounsbuilder funding… we just need to know whether a) we trust that the subDAO will steward those funds in a way that is positive for Nouns DAO, and b) if the cumulative ask is an amount of our treasury we are comfortable \"locking up\" until we see the cultural ROI from that spending.” Relation to our prop: NFTR can be viewed as a venture investment, though all funds will be incrementally added to the NFTR DAO, and their usage will be determined by DAO members (20% NFTR team, 10% NounsDAO). As a contributing member of Nouns and an innovator in the space, it can be reasonably assumed that DigitalOil will be an admirable steward of NFTR and its association to the Nouns brand and DAO model. \n\n**284: PizzaDAO**: Executed prop to fund PizzaDAO’s global pizza party, featuring Nouns branding and Noggle props. Here, Nouns served as sponsor for another DAO’s mission while perpetuating the Nouns meme. Relation to our prop: Not only will Nouns’ branding be integrated into NFTR’s NFTs and platform; NFTR’s DAO structure will inherently mimic the ideal web3 standard established by NounsDAO, eternally perpetuating the meme and the model. \n\n# NFTR Revenue Model\n\nMultiple revenue streams that will flow to the NFTR DAO Treasury.\n* Paid Namings (0.01 ETH, one-time lifetime fee, adjustable by the DAO)\n* NFTR Marketplace Revenue (5% fee of name trade value, adjustable by the DAO)\n* Daily Nounish NFT Mints\n* Golden Ticket sale fees ([GTKs are an existing](https://www.nftr.name/#/golden-ticket) NFTR-created ERC-20 that token-gates NFTR’s top 1000 names)\n* Fees from eventual advanced NFTR features (NFT Groups, subdomains, etc.)\n\n# How NFTR will proliferate Nouns\n\n* Finish building a web3 standard in the model of Nouns DAO\n* Nounish governance NFTs\n* Nouns DAO will become a major contributor to the NFTR DAO\n* Nouns DAO maintains a significant influence (10% voting weight) over NFTR DAO props. Note that if Nouns chooses to exert this influence it would likely be by delegation to interested parties.\n\n# Deliverables\n\n* Adopt Nouns DAO governance structure (includes turning over ownership of the protocol contracts to the Nounish NFTR DAO) via Nouns Builder DAO deployment.\n\n![NFTR governance becomes Nounish](https://i.imgur.com/7qZ3KV5.png)\n*NFTR governance becomes Nounish*\n\n![Nouns profile pages on NFTR would show different than profile pages for other NFTs](https://i.imgur.com/o9GiXGg.png)\n* Nouns profile pages on NFTR would show different than profile pages for other NFTs\n* 10% of minted NFTs go straight to Nouns DAO treasury\n* 20% of minted NFTs are sent to the NFTR team address\n* 5% of minted NFTs go to a contract governed by [Golden Ticket](https://www.nftr.name/#/golden-ticket) holders\n* The other 65% of NFTs are auctioned daily with proceeds going 100% to the Treasury\n* Outfit our daily NFTs with ⌐◧-◧\n\n![NFTR DAO daily NFT early concept](https://i.imgur.com/VEJKMwI.png)\n*NFTR DAO daily NFT early concept*\n\nSupply every Nouns NFT (forever) with a Naming Credit (existing and future), good for a free name + associated NFTR Profile (accessible by [name].nftr.name). This includes development of a PR into the [nouns.wtf](http://nouns.wtf) front-end to facilitate naming upon auction settlement\n\n![Name your Noun on NFTR for free with a naming credit granted for each newly acquired Noun](https://i.imgur.com/TIdKeRz.png)\n*Name your Noun on NFTR for free with a naming credit granted for each newly acquired Noun*\n\nFurther customize Nouns NFTR Profiles, integrating Nouns-specific utility (e.g. delegation plugin, vote bidding plugin, etc.)\n\n# Funding Request\n* 80 ETH to seed the NFTR DAO Registry for decentralized use by NFTR DAO. NFTR will direct 5% of daily auction proceeds to the Nouns DAO treasury up to 80 ETH.\n* All funding directs to a 2/3 multisig controlled by Noun12, Joel & Digital Oil until the NFTR DAO treasury is ready to receive the funds.\n\nThese are some of the initiatives the NFTR team envisions will be proposed:\n\n**Team expansion**\nFunding permits core team to work continuously on NFTR, in addition to funding additional hires to accelerate development (frontend + backend), event indexer, maintenance, and community-facing roles, etc.\n\n**Marketing and Business Development**\nPromotion + NFT community education on the utilities of NFT Naming, as well as its essential nature in support of ERC-6551.\n\n**NFT Conference Sponsorship + Promotion**\n⌐◧-◧ x NFTR sponsorship at worldwide 2023-2024 NFT conferences\n\n**NFTR PropHouse**\n⌐◧-◧ x NFTR will create a PropHouse to solicit community-built utilities and dApps that leverage the universal NFT namespace.\n\n**Auditing**\nThe completed NFTR ecosystem includes new smart contracts that must undergo auditing to ensure their security and safety for trustless + immutable NFTR DAO ownership and operation.\n\n# Success Metrics\n* Wide-scale Adoption of native NFT Naming (1 mil+ domains registered)\n* Becoming the primary hub for ERC-6551 activity\n* Propagation of Nouns meme + Nouns DAO model as the ideal governance model for a business / decentralized web3 protocol\n* Steady demand for daily NFTR NFTs, which stock the NFTR DAO Treasury and keep NFTR as decentralized as possible, sustaining NFTR indefinitely as a standard on Ethereum\n",

          "description": "# PALACE X NOUNS\n\n![](https://imgur.com/AyEJ0vI.jpg)\n\n# **TLDR**\n\n•Fund the next four months to create a framework and legal agreement for Nouns and [Palace SkateBoards](https://www.instagram.com/palaceskateboards/) collaboration.\n\n• Lead by two members of the Synthetic team and Palace co-founder Gareth Skewis.\n\n• 4 months of operations\n\n• The collaboration will be built in **two phases**, legal and concept construction phase, and MFG execution.\n\n• This proposal aims to finance the project/legal that will organize everything for collaboration, as well as the construction of the concept/design/approach of the capsule. There is no physical delivery on this support.\n\n## **Concept**\n\nA defining underground force in menswear in the 2010s, Palace here echoes the new and weirdness of Nouns through a series of pieces that will hybridize their creative universes – inherently Italian, boldly new, translated anew. The initial inspiration will be built on the Palace catalog itself and on the undeniable influence of Nouns on nft culture.\n\n## **Introduction**\n\n[Palace Skateboards](https://www.instagram.com/palaceskateboards/) needs little introduction, but for the uninitiated, the London-based skateboarding and clothing brand has become a mainstay in the streetwear scene for incorporating 1990s and pop culture influences with their VHS-style clothing ads. In other words, it’s kitsch, cool, and everything in between.\n\n# **Why Palace?**\n\n[Palace](https://www.instagram.com/palaceskateboards/) began as a brand for skateboarders. It is now a brand for all. Models turn up for castings in Palace. Working class Glasgow dads sport Palace. Jay-Z wears Palace. So does Rihanna. Teenage girls sleep in Palace, dreaming of the heart-throbs they’ve seen wearing Palace online. 2018’s Wimbledon finalists played on court in Palace. Soundcloud rappers adore Palace. The ICA exhibits Palace. Serious DJs with peerless techno collections adorn their record boxes with Palace stickers. Ravers ingest ecstasy pills produced in the shape of Palace’s Tri-Ferg logo. Socio-political causes, including the plights of both Jeremy Corbyn and the people of Palestine, have been smartly memed in versions of the Palace triangle.\n\nA middle-aged architect can slyly intimate he has better kids than his colleagues by picking something up at Palace, even if it’s just their socks. Virgil Abloh and Marc Jacobs wear Palace. London tube station walls are adorned by carriage-length adverts for Palace. The bigwigs at Ralph Lauren were so taken by the irrepressible rise of Palace that Palace became its first ever collaborator in 50 years of singularly myth-making fashion history.\n![](https://imgur.com/dlwqvv6.gif)\n![](https://imgur.com/OEHdbcQ.jpg)\n![](https://imgur.com/KsVOGlC.gif)\nFashion’s favourite photographers Alasdair McLellan, Juergen Teller and David Sims shoot for Palace. Silicon Valley is full of people in Palace. Blue-chip stylists buy Palace from their own pocket money to lend their imagery some of the company’s off-rail styles and indigenous London magic. i-D and British Vogue carry Palace ads. Madonna and child (Rocco) have been photographed proudly wearing Palace. All the while, a fat lad on a Midlands housing estate is looking great and feeling even greater in Palace while waiting for his Chinese takeaway and playing Fortnite.\n\n## Strength in Numbers\n\nThe large take on several already-created collaborations and communication from other brands to the nft audience is an excellent entry point for the brand to reach fans and a new market. Likewise, for the Nouns community;  **significant increases in brand awareness, favorability for further collaborations, and open public interest in the brand, consequently becomes a win-win.** To highlight the ROI of the collaboration, let's look at promoting the Palace brand among your collaborations;\n\n[Gucci](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CjsKDzipOtF), [Mercedes](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CbXyjVPq0VI), [New Balance](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cr-s3WotGz1), [Adidas](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CoHewHju2Ii), [RIMOWA](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CoUlcMeqvAs), and many others.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/qCpbrcS.jpg)\n[PALACE JAPAN MAGAZINE](https://www.palaceskateboards.com/range/spring-2019/palace-japan-magazine/)\n\n**Approach**: Use public communication-powered resources to compare social media posts containing mentions of the Palace and Nouns brand, before and after the partnership.\n\"Outcome: Insight into the Marketing ROI of an NFT Dive from Palace\" **“ Significantly increases the reach of Nouns by talking to two sets of customers instead of one and gives a signal from one brand that the other brand is trusted by the upscale market.”**\n\n# **Phase One and Phase Two.**\n\n![](https://imgur.com/liP7MrS.jpg)\n\nDetailed legal processes and collaboration building over the next four months; **Phase one**\n\n• Recitals\n• Purpose\n• Confidentiality Clause\n• Commercial Clause\n• Investment Clause\n• Duties and Obligations of Collaborators\n• Reporting and Project Management\n• Intellectual Property Rights\n\n• Fashion product mix;\n• Creation and style;\n• Prototyping;\n• Product development;\n• Marketing and Sales Strategy;\n• Collection management;\n• Evaluation of results.\n\nFor the scope of this proposal, Synthetic team is acting as the liason on behalf of the Nouns community and will adhere to all non-confidentiality & legal agreements relevant to Palace's collaboration workflow. Synthetic will work closely with the Nouns community to share public work-in-progress updates regularly which do not breach the above said agreements.\n\nSynthetic is a mediator, and nouns have a proactive CC0 license, In short Palace would not need Synthetic for commercial construction, what we are doing is raising ideas and presenting about the Nouns ecosystem: the various subgroups, the vibe, and the importance.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/ObE6wW9.jpg)\n![](https://imgur.com/sC8GwqP.jpg)\n\n## Breakdown of legal conditions\n\n**Strategy**: Legal terms and already transcribed collaboration construction.\n\n(the terms below will be robustly written to avoid legal inconvenience)\n\n![](https://imgur.com/fPYHHdj.jpg)\n\n• Recreate the look and feel of the Palace collaborative product; designing new products for that collaboration; concentrated on multiple tacit marketing and management ideas that they share.\n\n• Synthetic and the built committee will be responsible for co-managing the community outreach and communication campaign during construction.\n\n• Creative control, both teams have to work within the decided parameters and cannot go beyond that and after each step, they must report to the other brand.\n\n• Marketing strategies will be created and built exclusively by the Palace team's design and construction team. (This is due to several cordial agreements that the brand already has with the media – Vogue, WWD, Hypebeast and others.)\n\n• Nouns Palace limited edition products will be restricted to online sales.\n\n# **Palace Nouns: What to expect**\n\nThe special line is a connection to the “new” and will feature easter eggs throughout to make each piece truly special. The icing on the cake? Palace will launch women's ready-to-wear designs, making this collaboration one for all genders. The build will be designed to be a capsule of 5 distinct items. Because both aesthetics have been merged, expect logos to do the same.\n\nOn Palace’s classics – we're talking tracksuits, jeans, football shirts, skate decks – you'll see the Nouns identity scattered throughout. You’ll see this synergy on other more luxurious pieces, like a shearling jacket, as well as other unusual collectibles.\n\nAnother surprise for collectors is noggles Palace – a witty homage to the ‘weird’ collection, if you will. The idea came up and its design is about to be created as a double brand, wrapped in the Palace Nouns monogram.\n\n## Palace Nouns: What will be delivered with the execution of phases two and one\n\nEntitled “Palace Nouns,” the capsule – comprises statement-making garments designed for the collaboration. Jackets, noogles palace, vests, and skateboard decks are some of the pieces that are designed to be present, all adorning the new graphics, intertwined with the unmistakable details of Palace and Nouns.\n\nGlobal communication, Palace maintains a standardization of communication between its clients to build and launch a new collaboration; In their coverage, many media outlets go into significant detail about their collaborations and make them public globally.\n\n• Looking ahead: Building a capsule\n\nA capsule collection is essentially a condensed version of a designer's vision/collaboration, often in limited edition, that transcends seasons and trends by being functional. Thus, focusing on building and delivering key looks, without the style and theatricality of a fashion show.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/5qLsHLr.jpg)\n\n**Nouns Palace will be a 5-item capsule.**\n\n**a % (percentage) of collection sales will be directed to the NounsDAO Treasury.**\n\n## Building in public\n\n**There is no precedent for similar proposals in Nouns**, a collaboration like this creates demand for interaction and content that can be used by other builders and future collaborations.\n\nMany of the processes built to reach an agreement with a corporate are extremely tiring and even building their direction and a good presentation, most corporations prioritize closed and legal agreements to add clauses and prioritize their Intellectual Property.\n\n• Create a [general structure](https://mirror.xyz/0x905Ca7a9479EA1B9a8CDeD74da98e3CC5E6E2949) together with lawyer consulting to detail the collaboration and develop material to serve as a reference for other builders.\n\n• Unfortunately, the fashion collaborations have had terrible results in Nouns. What makes this different?\n\nYes, we are aware that we have seen several proposals without any results, this creates a history for the community to reject future approaches in the same segment, but the work we are building is extremely detailed to avoid any interruption or lack of communication. Open and detailed communication framework, creation of the capsule aimed at the general public and construction of an official approach.\n\nBuilding an official approach aims to contain everything that is expected from collaboration and has never been met;\n\n•Campaign\n•Communication published on the Palace's official social media containing a pre-announcement of the launch date.\n•Sending email newsletters to existing customers, with previews of collaboration lookbooks.\n•Mainstream coverage, Palace is known for the buzz it creates when announcing its collaborations, due to the coverage and attention its clients and media outlets create.\n\nCollaboration is the combination of numbers and audience as well as the introduction to a new group of clients. **When we mention that there are no precedents built for Nouns, we reaffirm.**\n\n**Accountability**\n\nForm a Steering Committee: composed of [DeGenData](https://twitter.com/degendata), [Ccarella](https://twitter.com/ccarella), [Oni-apenoun](https://twitter.com/apenoun) and 1 other noun who have intimate knowledge of the brands present in the collaboration.\n\nProvide this committee with **frequent updates on clauses, legal terms, construction and execution of the collaboration.**\n\n[Supriyo](https://twitter.com/next_roy) and [Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi) also made themselves available to help us by monitoring the execution of the collaboration framework and giving us closer feedback.\n\n# **What has been done so far?**\n\nWhat has been done so far?\n\nThe Synthetic project is somewhat similar to Nouns, they are both test projects, so the constant change is aimed at future research and long-term construction.\n\nSome of our achievements and experiments during this period;\n\n\n![](https://imgur.com/fYjLkWZ.jpg)\n\n![](https://imgur.com/YbbKqSa.jpg)\n\n![](https://imgur.com/QXeZfjv.jpg)\n\nIn several of our experiments with DAO we had constructions just for the meme without considering the funding request.\n\nA document is being built on the mirror detailing our experiments and will be available on our [Twitter.](https://twitter.com/synthetic_eth)\n\n![](https://imgur.com/aQHXdNh.jpg)\n\n# **FAQ**\n\n• Will there be any activation exclusively for noun holders?\n\nYes, In short - we will be designing the capsule with a variety of nouns specific perks in mind. Details will be defined during the ideation of the capsule.\n\n• Will the capsule be made available globally?\n\nYes, with the exception of one item that will be available exclusively in certain regions.\n\n• Will sales also be available in physical stores?\n\nNouns Palace limited edition products will be restricted to online sales.\n\n• Does this proposal cover actually creating the capsule? So the end result is ultimately Palace x Nouns clothes I can buy online?\n\nThis proposal covers the consolidation of legal terms, as well as the construction of the idealization/concept for creating the capsule. The construction with already defined direction and execution of the capsule will start in phase two (second support).\n\n## Funding Request\n\nOperations & Admin Compensation - €47.000\n\n• Compensation + fees for 4 Months of two full-time synthetic team members. €37.600\n**(€4700 per member/month)**\n\n• Legal expenses - €15400\nLawyer consulting on clauses clauses established by Palace\n\nTotal =\n**€62400**\n\n# **Conclusion**\n    \n• A collaboration is being established between Palace and Nouns.\n\n• The request for this support covers compensation for the next four months of the team and legal processes and the construction of the ideation and detailing of the designer's capsule/collection.\n\n• There is no physical delivery of this support.\n\n• Marketing strategies will be created and built exclusively by the Palace project team.\n\n• The importance of this collaboration for Nouns is absolute, where you have a conversation between two audiences, one of which is global.\n\n• The specific amount of mass production of capsule items is still under study and will be detailed in the second support raised for the second phase.\n\n\n# **Team:**\n\n[Synthetic](https://twitter.com/synthetic_eth): project dedicated to the creation and transmission connections. Through this model, Synthetic has already contributed to five projects for the Nouns.\n\n**Considering the inopportune timing and where much of the attention is being directed towards the fork. This proposal has been restudied and rewritten a few times in the last week with feedback from the community and the committee itself considering the current market.**\n\n**Questions or comments?

Everyday Ed B faces a new challenge – having to fight off racists at Trader Joes while perusing the vegan aisle, or running butt ass naked for a couple of dollars to pay his rent, OR having to sell photos of himself on the internet to help fund his next record – BUT they never stop him from pushing towards his dream of becoming the Beyoncé of puppets.\n\n## FORMAT\n\n* 10-12 minute web(3)isode\n* Stop motion and mixed media animation.\n\n___\n![](https://imgur.com/aah6X7X.jpg)\n# Pilot Episode\n\n## SYNOPSIS\n\n“A Song About Black Love” - Infatuated by a blossoming love interest, Ed B works out a new song about the joys of Black love. Billy, Ed’s bandmate, roommate and white ally, questions a hidden secret within Ed’s relationship and mayhem ensues.\n\n## FUNDING\n\n“A Song About Black Love” was self funded by Ed Balloon in 2022 primarily through the sale of NFTs. The tentpole fundraising project was the Run Ed Collection, a first-of-its-kind generative sound and motion NFT project that blended stop-motion, 2D and 3D animation, and music. Ed Balloon dropped the 1000 piece collection and it sold out, kickstarting production of the pilot. To help uplift other artists, Ed Balloon pledged 50 percent of the collection’s secondary sales toward The Ed Balloon Generational Wealth Fund, which collects work from Black and other under-represented artists in Web3.\n\n## CAST\n\n**Ed B “The Puppet”** | Ed Balloon\n**Billy** | Seth Green (Robot Chicken, Family Guy)\n**Peggy** | Blair Socci (Comedian)\n**Savannah** | Destiny Lavigne\n___\n# Nouns Integration in New Episodes\n\nThe possibilities for Nouns integration within the Ed B The Puppet universe are infinite. Noggles can be introduced as unique accessories that Ed and Billy can interact with, enabling them to solve problems or embark on new adventures. Noun characters could even make an appearance, bringing a sense of curiosity, wonder, or even magical qualities to the narrative.\n\n___\n![](https://imgur.com/Rw9HCbF.jpg)\n# Project Objective\n\n## Amplify Diversity\n\nBy creating content that celebrates and embraces diversity, we can showcase a wide array of perspectives and experiences. The Ed B ‘The Puppet’ Show will feature characters from different backgrounds, challenging stereotypes and fostering empathy among audiences. Through collaboration with the Nouns, we aim to elevate the visibility of diverse voices and promote a more inclusive entertainment landscape.\n\n## Utilize Satire for Social Commentary\n\nSatire serves as a powerful tool for social commentary, allowing us to address pertinent societal issues in a thought-provoking and engaging manner. By employing satire, we can challenge the status quo, stimulate critical thinking, and spark conversations that lead to positive change. Our collaboration with the Nouns will provide a platform for satirical content that encourages viewers to question and reconsider established norms.\n\n## Promote Collaboration and Solidarity\n\nOur project embraces the spirit of collaboration within the web3 community. By partnering with the Nouns, we aim to showcase the power of collaboration in amplifying diverse voices and driving innovation. Through cross-platform promotions, joint marketing initiatives, and immersive fan experiences, we can create a unified front that promotes solidarity within the industry. We will be using noun features (Noggles, characters, etc) in these episodes.\n\n___\n![](https://imgur.com/LGpjxXz.jpg)\n# Creative Team\n\n## Ed Balloon [Series Creator & Creative Director]\n\nSpearheading cultural representation and identity through his music and digital art, Ed Balloon has solidified himself not only as a Web3 artist and musician but also as a community leader.  Known for his innovative approach to music making, dynamic production style, and unique blend of electronic, hip-hop, and R&B, his 2022 Run Ed collection was presented as a one-of-a-kind generative sound and motion endeavor that blended stop-motion, 2D and 3D animation, and music. To help uplift other artists, 50 percent of the collection’s secondary sales continued to go toward The Ed Balloon Generational Wealth Fund, which collects work from Black and other under-represented artists in Web3. The pioneering musician also recently self-funded through the sale of NFTs the stop motion animated satire \"A SONG ABOUT BLACK LOVE.”  Executive produced by Daveed Diggs and starring Ed alongside actor Seth Green, the film showcases the difficulties of finding love as a black puppet.  Ed was also recently nominated to nftnow's NFT100, a celebration of the top 100 influential creators and community leaders in the NFT space.\n\nTwitter: @Ed_Balloon\n\n## Daveed Diggs [Executive Producer]\n* Vocalist in experimental hip hop group Clipping.\n* Co-star in The Little Mermaid, Hamilton, Snowpiercer, Wonder, Velvet Buzzsaw\n* Writer and Producer of Blindspotting\n* Tony and Grammy Winner.

We believe the app will enhance voter participation and democratize decision-making. The app will also serve as a valuable onboarding tool for new members and complement our existing governance clients. \n\n## Description\nWe have been developing an iOS app for NounsDAO. Our primary objective is to boost voter participation by providing Nouners with a user-friendly app that simplifies interactions with the Nouns protocol. We firmly believe that casting votes should be as effortless as sending a text message.\nThe core features will empower Nouners and community members to access the latest information and interact seamlessly with the Nouns protocol. Additionally, our experimental features will open doors to new onboarding methods, enhance community engagement and discover new utility. This app will be a valuable addition to existing governance clients, such as Nounsagora, Voter, Mmmogu, Nounoclock, Shenounigans, and many others.\n\n## Core Features List\n* Feed tab: Featuring the latest community, auction, trade, and proposal information in a clean and concise format.\n* Community tab: Providing an easy and concise way to find Nouners and delegates.\n* Auctions tab: Displaying the latest auction and market information from platforms like Opensea, LooksRare, Blur, etc.\n* Proposals tab: Read, track, and share proposals.\n* Wallet tab: Connect your wallet, check your Noun bags, cast and delegate votes (with Metamask, Rainbow, etc., integration).\n* Push notifications: A flexible notifications center for all activities, including notifications for specific trait minting, trades, delegations, etc.\n\n## Experimental Features\n* AirPlay support: Stream \"A Nouns Movie: Rise of Blus\" from the app to a monitor or TV.\n* Maps support: Display cities where Nouners and community members travel and reside (limited to locality).\n* NFTs: Distribute commemorative NFTs to active participants (those who check auctions more than three times a week receive a code to mint a unique Nounish NFT).\n\n## Timeline\n* Core features delivered in 1-2 months\n* Experimental Features in 4 months\n\n## Git repo\n* We welcome PRs at\nhttps://github.com/fiveoceans-dev/nouns-mobile/tree/main/ios-swift\n\n## Budget\n10 eth - UI design\n15 eth - retrofund\n30 eth - R&D next 5 months\n12 eth - maintanance ∞\n**Total: 67 eth**\n\n## Transaction\n\nSend 67 eth to [Five](https://twitter.com/fiveoceans_dev)\n0x7Bd4cdbD92ab09fA689ED899cddDD6ECCFeF7a54\n\n## Screenshots\n* ### Splash screen\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hy-zc4OR2.gif)\n\n* ### Auction\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HklGc4_Rn.gif)\n\n* ### Proposals\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BklzcVO0n.gif)\n\n* ### Wallet\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1Jf5EuC2.gif)",

          "description": "# (w)stETH to rETH Treasury Diversification 🐮\n\n## Description\n\nFollowing the [recent proposal](https://nouns.wtf/vote/320) to test CronFi’s TWAMM solution for [LST diversification](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10) of Nouns treasury, we at CoW Protocol would like to propose testing execution using our unique batch auction process before proceeding with the full 7k ETH amount. \n\nThere’s been interest in diversifying [Nouns DAO treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10), specifically stETH→rETH. Recently some twitter avatars have [posted](https://twitter.com/0x70626a/status/1684936056443969536) a good analysis of the 500 ETH TWAMM trade, specifically, that the trade resulted in 518.51 rETH received for 500 wstETH (a whopping 1.25% slippage for a stable swap!). We believe CoW Protocol will provide a much more competitive execution price, that is compatible with fair market prices.\n\n## Background\n\nCoW Protocol has been using a multi-token batch auction on Ethereum mainnet for over two years, facilitating [>$27.3B of trading volume](https://dune.com/cowprotocol/cowswap). CoW Protocol uniquely allows its users to get best execution prices even with a lax slippage tolerance thanks to 15 competitive solvers participating in an auction mechanism that protects the users by granting the right to execute the trade to the solver offering maximal price improvement.\n\nCoW Protocol is used by a [number of DAOs](https://cow.fi/daos) for their trading operations including ENS, Aave, Nexus Mutual, Gnosis, Karpatkey, Olympus DAO, Badger DAO, Yearn and more. \n\n## Advantages\n\nCoW Protocol pioneered intent-based trading since its inception in early 2021. This allows users to define order parameters without specifying the actual execution path (`calldata`). Users should expect the most optimised execution route to be chosen by the winning solver at the time of execution. \n\n## Considerations\n\nGiven a sell order of 500 wstETH→rETH there are several options for order placement that can provide different properties. We'll focus on a *TWAP* order setup although it seems to not be necessary in a smaller 500 ETH trade - the purpose is to demonstrate how a larger order could be set up.\n\nFor a 500 wstETH→rETH we propose to use a TWAP order of 5 equal parts worth 100 wstETH each. This may result in an execution up to 525 rETH.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJfUbBKo2.png)\n\n### `TWAP` Conditional order\n\n* Launch date: August 17th, 2023. [See twitter post.](https://twitter.com/CoWSwap/status/1692152855694803112?s=20)\n* Transactional volume: ~$4.2M. [See dune query](https://dune.com/cowprotocol/cow-swap-limit-orders-kpis).\n* Value held within `ExtensibleFallbackHandler`-upgraded Safes: ~$12.3M\n\nThe TWAP [implementation](https://github.com/cowprotocol/composable-cow) uses a constant limit price across each. Given the stability of wstETH→rETH, the limit price may be set in advance with a high confidence that this will be representative at the time the proposal is executed (and for the duration of the TWAP).\n\nOrder parameters suggested for this proposal:\n* Limit price: 1 wstETH = 1.038 rETH. This includes 1% slippage tolerance to allow for charging a fee from the sell token and to get higher confidence in execution. **It is still expected to be executed with a much lower slippage in practice.** See the above mentioned dune dashboard's *'order surplus'* whereby the order's slippage is protected.\n* 5 equal parts of 100 wstETH\n* Time intervals of two hours between parts \n\n## Methodology\n\nTo achieve this TWAP, the proposed transaction bundle will:\n\n1. Wrap the required `stETH` to `wstETH` so that it may be traded.\n2. Create a `Safe` owned by the DAO treasury that is used as a staging contract for the TWAP.\n3. Trigger the TWAP, with the resulting `rETH` from each swap being sent directly back to the DAO treasury.\n\n### Use of `Safe`\n\n* Developers: `Safe`\n* Audits: [See their Github Repository](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/tree/af488f0a649a3be2ea01e0f7a6af1587d0250c2d/docs).\n\nThe `Safe` is used as a staging area for the funds used in the TWAP. As CoW Protocol uses intent based trading, the `owner` of the order needs to sign their intent (done using a private key for an `EOA`, done using [EIP-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271) for a smart contract). \n\nWith this requirement in mind, the DAO treasury contract for Nouns doesn't support EIP-1271. This is why a `Safe` is used in combination with `ComposableCoW` (detailed below).\n\nThe `Safe` that is created in the proposal bundle **ensures that the only owner is set to the DAO Treasury**. At all times, the funds remain under the direct control of the DAO treasury with the same timelock conditions.\n\n#### Execution Risk\n\nIn the transaction bundle funds are sent atomically to a newly created `Safe`. This means that the `Safe`'s address needs to be calculated beforehand. This is done using `CREATE2` logic, therefore the `Safe` is created at a deterministic address. The flow:\n\n1. DAO Treasury sets an approval on `wstETH` for the to-be-created `Safe`.\n2. The `Safe` is created and initialised.\n3. The funds are **PULLED** from the DAO Treasury to the `Safe`.\n\nCritically, with the above methodology there is *no ability for funds to be sent to an address where they are not retrievable*.\n\n**CAUTION:** This candidate proposal assumes successful passage of [Proposal #359](https://nouns.wtf/vote/359) **AND** no intermediate proposal that interacts with the new treasury's balance of `wstETH`.\n\n### Use of `ComposableCoW` / `TWAP`\n\n* Developer: mfw78 (funded by CowDAO Grants Program, and now a [Core Contributor to CoW Protocol](https://snapshot.org/#/cowgrants.eth/proposal/0x0202a88c6792d1bd1e534cf1da94769130f495e72247e666b4afff8b22da9db0)).\n* Audits (jointly funded by `Safe` and CoW Protocol): [Ackee](https://github.com/cowprotocol/composable-cow/blob/main/audits/ackee-blockchain-cow-protocol-composablecow-extensiblefallbackhandler-report-1.2.pdf), [Gnosis Internal](https://github.com/cowprotocol/composable-cow/blob/main/audits/gnosis-ComposableCoWMayJul2023.pdf).\n* Other: Repository recently on-boarded to [CoW Protocol GitHub organisation](https://github.com/cowprotocol/).\n\n`ComposableCoW` is a conditional smart order framework that was [incubated by the CoW Grants Program](https://snapshot.org/#/cowgrants.eth/proposal/0xb7815ca1f5aea2ec537295fd452332680eb1be379f3356950dc8ba151d83f9c5). `TWAP` is an order type implemented in the `ComposableCoW` framework. The contracts are thoroughly tested and audited. To date, volume processed exceeds ~$4.2M.\n\nUsing `ComposableCoW`, a smart contract (such as the `Safe` deployed in the proposal) is able to autonomously indicate its intent to trade. This intent is monitored by a *Watch Tower* (currently a Tenderly Web3 Action, deployed by the CoW Protocol team), with the intent relayed to the CoW Protocol API. In this framework - for TWAP, unlike `Milkman` - the smart contract specifies the *entire order structure to be submitted to the API*. There are no trust assumptions placed in the Watch Tower (besides the Watch Tower not running, leading to a griefing attack, but CoW Protocol for reputational reasons are incentivised to keep the Watch Tower operational).\n\n#### Differences compared to `Milkman`\n\nBoth were funded by the CoW Protocol Grants Program. `Milkman` seeks to solve the issue of an autonomous swap from ABC→XYZ tokens, whereas `ComposableCoW` provides an entire framework for producing *conditional* orders. TWAP is an example of a conditional order built with this framework - allowing a large trade to settle in multiple parts over time, minimising price impact.\n\n## Proposal Operations\n\nThe operations in the proposal are:\n\n1. Approve the required amount of `stETH` for wrapping into `wstETH`.\n2. Wrap `stETH` into `wstETH`.\n3. Approve the to-be-created Safe to use the Executor's `wstETH`.\n4. Create the trading `Safe` (owner: Exector, owners: 1).\n5. Configure the `Safe`:\n    i. Set `ComposableCoW` as the domain verifier for `GPv2Settlement` (CoW Protocol signing).\n    ii. Set the allowance for `GPv2VaultRelayer` to spend `wstETH` held by the `Safe`.\n    iii. Use `transferFrom` to pull funds from the `Executor` which what was already approved at (3).\n    iv. Create the `TWAP` order\n6. Confirm revocation of all allowances that were given to the `Safe` by the `Executor`.\n",

Our overarching goal is to amplify our influence, simplify operational processes, and champion those with genuine grassroots credibility.\n\n**GNARS** as an acronym crystallizes our ethos, mirroring the Nouns' virtuous cycle, acting as our serendipity machine:\n\n- **Goodwill**: Renewing skateparks and introducing new, shred-worthy sculptures\n- **Network**: Culturally sensitive contributions earn us both visibility and respect\n- **Advocacy**: Harmonising with communities helps us draw in new enthusiasts\n- **Releases**: Collective creative outputs with shared proceeds bolster funding\n- **Serendipity**: Getting onchain empowers shredders, opening fresh avenues\n\n---\n\n## 🌟 Opportunity\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreihhjrjim3rtjd6k2drh6r5gpy5i7xfp22gjcuouujecd2p4arkxhq)\n\nOur target of onboarding a million shredders might seem lofty, but it's just a fraction - 0.2% - of the 490 million participants in extreme sports.\n\nTo provide some perspective, skateboarding alone boasts 85 million participants. Industries like adventure tourism further validate our optimistic projections, given their sustained growth trajectories.\n\n---\n\n## 🧭 Approach and Strategy\n\n[![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeifkzcdwnvktxhmf47i67iel4gqyqtqc6jkhqc2xfxxqnfnmjr5dja)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3unXaYpMl8)\n\n📝 *Watch this NounGnarversary celebration funded via Prop House [on YouTube ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3unXaYpMl8)*\n\nGnars takes pride in our unique, community-focused contributions to skate culture. Here's how we plan to maximize our impact:\n\n- **Local Council Engagement**: Propose collaborations with councils, emphasising mutual benefits. Secure permissions for QR/NFC plaques.\n- **Community Consultation**: Prioritise feedback, ensuring final outputs align with community needs and aspirations.\n- **Skateable Art**: Commission designs that are both visually appealing and skateable, enhancing park functionality.\n- **Skate Community Collaborations**: Organise events to spotlight our mission. Rope in local influencers as ambassadors.\n- **Educational Initiatives**: Engage with schools and clubs, emphasising the interplay of art, skateboarding, and community projects.\n- **Media Outreach**: Use local media to showcase project completions and events, underscoring our tech integrations.\n- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Use digital tools to gauge user engagement and gather feedback, refining future strategies.\n\nOur dual focus on the skateboarding community and local councils ensures that our initiatives resonate with authentic cultural value.\n\n---\n\n## 📊 Budget Breakdown\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeihebdyhnukubmcxl3tkhlqrn3dzwx5ace6uck2l2cd6ggb6tdq72i)\n\nPer the TLDR, our ask is 200 ETH to our treausury (DAO executor) at `gnars.eth`, outlined as:\n\n- **Continuous park enhancements - 150 ETH**\n    - Skate and other terrain park refurbishments globally\n    - Shred-worthy Nouns themed sculpture fabrications\n    - Installs of commemorative QR/NFC enabled plaques\n    - Unveiling and onboarding events fully documented\n    - Releases of all works onchain as paid or free mints\n    - All mint proceeds split with creators and treasury\n    - Being enabled by Nouns is core to Gnars' story\n- **Administration of GNARS strategy - 42 ETH**\n    - Coordinate community-driven promotional activities\n    - Manage various Gnars Media House curatorial efforts\n    - Oversee day to day operations and general administration\n    - Experiment with retro rewards (up to 2 ETH/month/contributor)\n    - Community discord moderation and shredder onboarding\n    - Collaborate with Rainbow wallet on QR / NFC activations\n    - Disburse free Gnars (10%) from multisig for shredders\n    - Provide assistance to our pods and working groups\n- **Migrate Gnars to Zora Network - 8 ETH**\n    - Add a timelock period/minimum quorum before new DAO opens up for props so nobody captures the first few props\n    - Deploy all contracts to Zora\n    - Edit frontend to integrate with Zora\n    - Migrate subgraph\n    - Implement gnars claiming process\n    - Plan for treasury migration\n    - Complete full migration\n\n📝 *Through onchain governance we will allocate funds as earmarked and will be experimenting with Partitions for a holistic approach to treasury management.

Your continued encouragement, feedback, and trust are what make such endeavors possible. By embracing our proposal, you're not just endorsing a project, but championing the blend of art, culture, and authenticity that both Nouns and Gnars represent.\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeif2wakdatsq7urcefu2r7oo57vpmuobfheqk5u45dky5eo2whw2va)\n\nIn gratitude for your time and consideration, and as a gesture of our appreciation, we've created a unique, commemorative NFT to mark the submission of this proposal. For the month of Shredtember, we invite you to [mint this FREE NFT](https://gna.rs/hypercycle) and all Zora Protocol Rewards will be split between Nouns and Gnars treasuries. A special thank you for being an intrinsic part of our journey.\n\nYour voice matters. As we conclude, we earnestly encourage each member of the Nouns community to cast their vote with comment. Together, let's continue to reshape, reimagine, and literally Shred the Nouns.\n\nThank you for considering a future where passion, play, and purpose collide!\n\nBe sure to [scroll our Twitter](https://twitter.com/gnars_dao) for all the latest happenings.\n\nSHRΞD M❍RE\n\n⌐◨🤘◨",
