This activation will take place during NFT NYC (June 20 – 23) and will feature:\n- Hand painted mural by Jasper Wong who is an artist and founder of Worldwide Walls (http://www.powwowworldwide.com/ 3), the mural will be viewable from June 20 – July 10 and will feature Nouns in all their glory.\n- Simple website / landing page to commemorate the mural\n\n**The activation is estimated to generate ~1.7M impressions. The total amount being requested is 72.5 ETH.**\n\n## Why Should You Care? \nWe can all agree that art is a pretty powerful communicator; it appeals to our emotions, forces us to think, and does a pretty good job of bringing us together on some level. We hope to use this power to accomplish the following: \n- Increase awareness of Nouns at NFT NYC—online and IRL\n- Increase brand awareness of the Nouns DAO as a leader in the industry;\n- Invite NFT enthusiasts and the public at large to become involved with the Nouns DAO community. We want to let people know that we are here and we invite them to come build the future with us; and,\n- Create a website (nounsirl.live) that tells the story behind the art (plan is to also include art from other cities on the tour)\n  - High-res images and time lapse video of the mural, artist’s explanation etc.\n  - Links to Nouns website, twitter, discord, etc.  \n\n## Nouns IRL — Person, Place, Thing\nNouns: person, place, thing… We thought that it would be really cool to bring this concept to IRL via fun and engaging art activations around the world. Each stop on the tour will feature a specific artist (or group of artists), a city, and an interesting Nounified art piece. Imagine Nouns on Venice Beach, or Nouns on a rehabilitated basketball court in Chicago. Imagine the looks on people’s faces if a huge inflated Noun floated by them in Miami. These art activations will vary in flight time from several weeks to several months, with the goal being to create longer lasting pieces that become a part of the cultural backdrop in the city. There are a ton of things we can explore on this tour and we think NFT NYC would be a perfect place to start. \n\n## Person\nJasper Wong, founder of [Worldwide Walls](https://www.instagram.com/powwowworldwide/?hl=en).\n\nJasper Wong is an artist, illustrator, curator and art director; his art style can be described as a unique clash of Asian-influenced pop culture on paper. Jasper has exhibited worldwide in places such as Japan, California, France, London, Mexico, New York, Hong Kong, Chicago, and Australia. Jasper is also extremely accomplished having been chosen as one of the HB100, a list of Hypebeast’s 100 most influential figures in the industry, which includes the likes of Kaws, Pharrell, Banksy, Jay Z and Kanye West.\n\nJasper is a big fan of Nouns, he has been following the project for some time and is very excited at the opportunity to get involved with the DAO. In addition to painting the mural, Jasper will be sending out Nouns-related messages on his social media platforms to engage his followers before and during the mural’s flight time. Jasper is also very well known within the art community and will attempt to leverage his network to invite some of his artist friends to hang out with him at the completed mural during NFT NYC. The goal will be to use both Jasper and his artist friends’ followers to generate additional traffic at the mural and further amplify social media impressions.\n\nJasper is very involved with the community through his non-profit organisation Pow! Wow! of which he is the creator and lead director. Pow! Wow! is a group of contemporary artists committed to community enrichment through the creation of art outreach programs, educational programs, and engaging the community in the creation and appreciation of art. Pow! Wow! has executed projects (murals, school renovations, basketball courts, etc.) in 13 cities around the globe, such as Honolulu, Taipei, Tokyo, Nepal, Guam, Seoul, Israel, and others. \n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/Gd2UFLO.jpg)\n_(Jasper Wong)_\n\n## Place\nNew York City during NFT NYC, the Super Bowl of NFT conferences.\n\nNFT NYC is the perfect staging ground for the first Nouns IRL activation. One of the stated missions of the DAO is to attract builders/creatives who are ready to create products that proliferate the Nouns brand to a wider audience and shed positive light on the concept of DAOs. NFT/crypto enthusiasts attending NFT NYC are a perfect target for this mission as many are informed about the space and are also builders/creatives looking for a project to support. The general public present in New York at this time will be surrounded by a ton of NFT related themes which should generate interest and curiosity. Many of these people (who may also be builders/creatives) have not yet fully explored the crypto space, this will be an opportunity to capture their attention and encourage them to become involved with Nouns DAO.\n\n## Thing\nSharable hand painted mural art piece promoting Nouns and a simple website.\n\nWe have encouraged Jasper to create a mural in his style that is a conversational piece. The mural will act as an introduction to the crypto space for many newcomers, we hope that it inspires a sense of curiosity and an urge to dig deeper. For the more experienced, the mural will act as an introduction to Nouns; we hope that it shows them the many possibilities of being involved with the DAO. The overall goal is to create a compelling piece which introduces Nouns to the viewer and inspires the viewer to get involved. \n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/HKKgICa.png)\n\nThe mural will be located at 300 W Broadway (next to the entrance of the Soho Grand Hotel, facing the busy Holland Tunnel) and will measure 8’9” H x 16’ W in size.\n\nAs mentioned above, the ultimate goal is to launch a continued effort to promote Nouns worldwide through art. NYC is the first stop of the tour. The Nouns IRL website will act as an artefact for this and all future activations. The website will contain high-res images, time lapse video, artist bio, story behind the art, and links to the discord, the main Nouns website, discourse, etc. \n\n## Budget (all figures are in USD):\n- Mural Wall: $36,000.00:\nWe have been advised by the wall company that a soft hold will be placed on the mural location for us at least until the 10th of June.\n- Artist: $40,000.00\n- Team: $25,000.00\n- Nouns IRL Landing page + capturing of video and photos for social: $11,000.00\n- Travel / Accommodations: $6,000.00\n\n**Total: $118,000.00, total ETH ask: 72.5 ETH**\n_Based on ~$1,700.00 price of ETH as of June 3, 2022; we have added ~3 additional ETH to try and account for volatility and fees._\n\n## Team\nThis activation is being executed by the [Nouns Collective](https://twitter.com/Nounscollectiv3) (formerly the Collective DAO) which is a liquid super team made up of friends building playful, useful, and beautiful products and experiences with the crypto communities they love. We have previously contributed to the community via the [Nouns iOS app](https://www.nounsapp.wtf/) (proposal 6) which was officially launched on May 16, 2022. The Nouns Collective is composed of experienced founders, brand builders, and developers with over 15 years of experience building successful products. \n\nFor this activation we have teamed up with [@miss_singh](https://twitter.com/Miss_Singh) who is a creative professional, cultural connector, community builder, experiential expert, and entrepreneur. @miss_singh has over two decades of experience that spans industries from tech, marketing, fashion and retail with her most recent gig being with Shopify. @miss_singh is extremely excited to jump into the Web3 world with us and looks to use her considerable experience and talents to deliver a memorable and lasting experience.\n\n## To be Nountinued…\n\nWe are super excited to merge Nouns with IRL. The Nouns community is strong and vibrant; we hope to show the world who we are and what we are about. The best way to onboard more individuals, especially builders, into the space is to meet them where they are. DAOs, NFTs, blockchains, this can all be difficult to grasp for newcomers. Using familiar / traditional mediums of delivery (pop-ups, art, events, etc.) to introduce these concepts are an effective way to drive engagement. We hope that this stop on the tour will be the first of many to come!\n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/9upXNjf.png)\n_(Uniqlo Mural, Jasper Wong)_",

No knock on the artist or proposer, that’s just my feelings based off other art-related props & grants we’ve seen that have had clearer value adds and/or were more cost-effective.",

Even if the Plaintiffs' motivations could be politically motivated, it seems PT may have indeed broken some lottery and/or banking laws in NY, or at least, it is far from a sure thing that they didn't. Moreover, it was mentioned that this should probably have been a planned-for eventuality for such a protocol (to be sued by the State) and Nouncil worries about the precedent of deploying Nouns treasury to fund this kind of predictable legal battle (hat tip Wag.)

          "reason": "It seems that the reason we're discussing gifting a noun to an extension project, which is unprecedented (we never discussed a gift nor discount to sharkdao, goop, etc), is that we were allocated 10% of future NFT supply (a new thing that Lil Nouns did). I'm voting AGAINST since I'm opposed to sending a signal to present and future nouns extensions that we value receiving NFT supply allocation in a special way.\n\nReceiving someone else's NFTs is kind of a headache. We're suddenly put into the position of having to make asset owner decisions (should we hold or sell) and in some cases such as this one we might have added governance responsibilities as well (e.g. have 10% responsibility of lil nouns' future). So unless we have some easy DAO level consensus on regularly selling the newly received NFTs, we're likely looking at the duties of holding onto an illiquid asset while incurring more DAO governance overhead. One might say that if we start receiving a lot of NFTs this way then some might really pop and have liquid markets and we might be able to experience some real ETH treasury gains through it. But if we really believed in that then we could have always bought new noun extension NFTs as pure investors with our ETH. I believe we have yet to do that because we don't think ourselves as NFT investors (even if the scope is limited to nouns extensions) and don't think that is where we create the most value from our attention. \n\nAn arrangement that we'd much rather prefer than being gifted NFT supply is a nouns extension buying Nouns with their treasury. In this arrangement, we get ETH and likely some governance participation as well, both things that we really like and no added responsibilities that we don't like. \n\nI'm not saying that we should be stingy or completely self centered in a short term way. I think Lil Nouns is a brilliant experiment and love that we're for example spinning up a lil nouns prop house and sending ETH their way to help bootstrap builders there, etc. I just think that rewarding NFT supply gifting over other acts such as buying nouns or participating in our governance (which both sharkdao and goop have done) sends the wrong message that is against our incentives. We want extensions to buy Nouns, submit proposals, and participate in our governance! Giving us assets for free can be nice but comparatively is meh. ",

      "description": "# Fia World Rally Championship × Nouns\n\n\nPosting this proposal on behalf of DonJon#2860\nAdditional Details / Screenshots [on Discourse](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/fia-world-rally-championship-x-nouns/1007)\n\n# Sponsor a 3 car team for the Fia World Rally Championships\n\n*This year, June the 24th-27th,the sixth leg of the World Rally Championship will be going down in Kenya. The event is the highest discipline of rallying governed by FIA.*\n\n*Being a native of Kenya, I decided to take into my care a team of 3 drivers both of who have extensive experience and have boasted great results in the rallies they have participated in. Mr Andrew Muiruri, the lead driver, who started his career under the FIA young stars and his co-driver Mr.Edward, one of the most experienced rally drivers in the Southern hemisphere, boasting over 51 podium finishes over a period of over 10 years ,by sponsoring them with 3 stock cars for modification,and to get them registration to be able to participate in the World Rally Championship.*\n\n[![Fia](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/044a29041eb3f76db7e423bd85fc93b1c9823b00.jpeg)](https://www.fia.com/events/world-rally-championship/season-2022/2022-world-rally-championship)\n\n# Proposal\n*I am proposing that my racing team partner with the Nouns in the World Rally Championship Safari Rally that is scheduled for the 24th of June. The initial ask is a one-time off cost and the rally team will be able to participate in future events (upto 20 events) for the next three years thereabout for almost a tenth or less of the current ask. (aprx 8-12 ETH)*\n\n# Benefits\n\n*This will be the first time any NFT project has participated in Rally sports, more so the biggest Rally event in the world, generating lots of publicity from people in and out of the Crypto fraternity. The same event last year generated 832 million impressions world-wide, from streaming sites(Red Bull TV, WRC+).*\n\n*•Nounified branding of team race cars and gear.\n•Registration costs paid to the WRC.\n•Servicing the cars to the performance and safety standards required by FIA.\n•Multiple ad work and promotion during and before the event.\n•Mechanical and car service.\n•Filming personnel.\n•Travel and accommodation expenses for the racing team\nEvent Mechanics personnel.\n•Spare parts.*\n\n\n[![Stephan.L of Citroen wrecked his rally car in Poland, which his mechanics fixed completely in less than 30 min.](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/8a0a1dd79f8daa3ea56e95199a2f7bc6eeebb81f.jpeg)\n\n\n## Media & Coverage\n*The event will be broadcasted on more than 30 live sports channels in over 50 countries all over the world. The Kenyan leg of the rally garnered 832 million impressions, putting up higher numbers than the Super Bowl and the Champions League. Streaming services such as Red Bull TV and WRC+ will also stream the event live.*\n\n## WRC Rally Car\n*WRC Rally cars are built to the standards stipulated in the FIA WRC Sporting Regulations Handbook. All participating Rally Cars are inspected by FIA, the governing body,to make sure they are up to safety and performance standards to the letter.*\n\n*Like all competition cars, a rally car features a roll cage, upgraded suspension and a strong braking system. In order to pound rough roads at high speeds, however, they require sturdier parts.\nBeefier engine mounts ensure the block won’t shake loose on bumpier road sections, while a thick aluminium skid plate prevents sharp rocks from lacerating an otherwise vulnerable oil pan. Meanwhile, bespoke wheels and tyres are essential for dealing with varied, challenging terrain.*\n\n*Today’s WRC cars are built to the specification set by the international motorsports governing body the FIA.In 2011, rules for WRC cars became more restrictive. Cars were smaller models and exotic materials such as titanium, magnesium and composite were forbidden expect when present in the base model. Initially, gear changes had to be made with a mechanical system, so the use of paddle shifters was not allowed, however this was reversed in 2015.*\n\n*In 2017, manufacturers were given more freedom to maximise aerodynamic performance, while the turbo restrictor diameter was increased from 33 mm to 36 mm, increasing the engine’s power output from 310 bhp to 380 bhp.*\n\n\n## Promotion and Nounified Onsite Clothing & Accessories\n*During the course of the Rally all members of Team Nouns will be donning some form of nounified apparel. The Rally driver’s and their co-drivers, the mechanics and the engineers (Service team) will wear noun safari hats or baseball hats to shield themselves from the scorching African sun.\nThe team will also be supplied with nounified towels to use after completing each leg. Any sort of supplies will also be carried around the site in nounified duffels. We plan to give away loads of t-shirts and umbrellas to willing spectators. Hoodies will be worn by the team throughout their stay in and out of venue*\n\n## Outdoor Advertising\n*There will be a total of 3 ads bearing Nouns DAO selected media. One billboard, one vide adboard and a projection mapping on the Kenya International Conference Centre*\n\n[![Ad1](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/ff6b265c6355db6c1464d7e5257135b873b8740d.jpeg)\n\n[![Ad2](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/1054a7bdfd1de50a4134a85f1c78c3b1d30ab4ae.jpeg)\n\n\n# Funding Request: 153 ETH\n**Pool 1: 150 ETH (50 ETH per Rally Car x3)**\nCost of Vehicular upgrades - 15 ETH per car\nRacing Gear - 5 ETH per car\nSafety Equipment - 10 ETH per car\nService team equipments - 10 ETH per car\nSpare Parts - 10 ETH per car\n[**A comprehensive and detailed breakdown of Pool 1 allocation is linked here.**](https://1drv.ms/w/s!AjtoTcl4akPtc3_sHE6lnP13jEU)\n\n**Pool 2: Sponsored by an external Sponsor**\nUsed to cater for the cost of hiring engineers,mechanics, fuel differentuals, registration costs and event fees.\n[**A comprehensive and detailed breakdown of Pool 2 allocation is linked here.**](https://1drv.ms/w/s!AjtoTcl4akPtd3yjyKfOShmsHes)\n\n**Pool 3: 3 ETH**\nAccomodation for the nouns team\nTravelling expenses\nPromotion\nMedia\nAdvertisment coverage.\n[**A comprehensive and detailed breakdown of Pool 3 allocation is linked here.**](https://1drv.ms/w/s!AjtoTcl4akPteQDVMzB5b-Xrwx4)\n\n*I plan to make a small grants request to compensate the artists responsible for the designing of the car wrap,racing suits and helmets and ads*\n\n*The team received external sponsorship of 40 ETH that will be deposited into Pool 2 (22 ETH) and the remainder covering part of Pool 3 (Originally 21 ETH now down to 3 ETH)*\n\n\n**Transaction Details:**\n```\ntx1: 153E to 0x6fbcB02a48505d396ceD4ACE46bf69754C72f197 (prop funding)\ntx2: 0.5E to apenoun.eth (prop coordination)\n```\n\n\n",

The concern was also voiced that the DAO owning the cars could be a cost/liability after the season (storage, etc.) Overall, we like the energy and the proposal was well written, but the majority voted No this time. We really like Don and his energy and hope he will stick around and build more within Nouns. Kudos to him for seeking lots of discussion on Discourse and holding open calls in the discord to take feedback. We should encourage this kind of builder to stick around.

      "description": "# Gamify fundraising for Ukraine by donating 51 ETH through the Rescue Toadz project\n\n\n## Summary\nThe goal is to donate 51 ETH for humanitarian aid to Ukraine and increase the popularity of the Rescue Toadz (https://rescuetoadz.xyz/) charity project so that more people start donating as well.\n\n## Methodology\nRescue Toadz is a charity project that gamifies the fundraising process. It is an NFT collection of 18 toadz with 100% of the funds being donated to Ukraine via Unchain Ukraine. A special bidding mechanic encourages people to donate more.\n\nThe gamified aspect is that you can not only mint toadz, but also transfer someone else’s toad in your wallet by matching or increasing their last donation. The toad then drops its noun glasses as POAP in the wallet of the original holder.\n\nThis mechanism is coded directly in the smart contract and a toad owner cannot prevent the toad from hopping into another wallet. This encourages people to donate more - if they want to keep their toad they need to increase the price of the donation or acquire back the toad if somebody donated more.\n\n100% of the funds are immediately sent from the Rescue Toadz smart contract to Unchain Ukraine. It is a pure charity project - the project devs make no money from it.\n\n## Why not donate directly to Unchain?\nThe idea is not only for Nouns DAO to donate, but also to encourage other people to donate as well. For example, NounsDAO will donate for already minted toadz and “steal” them from the previous owners. Some of them will then donate again to get their toad back.\n\nThe goal of the proposal is to donate 0.2 ETH for 5 toadz that are already minted and “steal” them from the previous owners and also raise the prices for two other toadz to 10 ETH and 40 ETH respectively.\n\n## Conclusion\nDonating 51 ETH through the Rescue Toadz project has the following benefits:\n\nFunds raised by NounsDAO to help Ukrainian people recover from the war\nRaised popularity of the Rescue Toadz charity project, so more people start donating\nPeople that had their Rescue Toad taken from them are incentivized to get it back by donating again.\nRecue Toadz or Noun Glasses NFTs collected by the NounsDAO\nRaised popularity of the iconic Nouns Glasses, which are dropped as POAP for everybody that participated",

          "reason": "I believe that the definition of definition is reinvention. To not be like your parents. To not be like your friends. To be yourself.\n\nCompletely.\n\nWhen I was young I had no sense of myself. All I was, was a product of all the fear and humiliation I suffered. Fear of my parents. The humiliation of teachers calling me “garbage can” and telling me I’d be mowing lawns for a living. And the very real terror of my fellow students. I was threatened and beaten up for the color of my skin and my size. I was skinny and clumsy, and when others would tease me I didn’t run home crying, wondering why.\n\nI knew all too well. I was there to be antagonized. In sports I was laughed at. A spaz. I was pretty good at boxing but only because the rage that filled my every waking moment made me wild and unpredictable. I fought with some strange fury. The other boys thought I was crazy.\n\nI hated myself all the time.\n\nAs stupid at it seems now, I wanted to talk like them, dress like them, carry myself with the ease of knowing that I wasn’t going to get pounded in the hallway between classes. Years passed and I learned to keep it all inside. I only talked to a few boys in my grade. Other losers. Some of them are to this day the greatest people I have ever known. Hang out with a guy who has had his head flushed down a toilet a few times, treat him with respect, and you’ll find a faithful friend forever. But even with friends, school sucked. Teachers gave me hard time.\n\nI didn’t think much of them either.\n\nThen came Mr. Pepperman, my advisor. He was a powerfully built Vietnam veteran, and he was scary. No one ever talked out of turn in his class. Once one kid did and Mr. P. lifted him off the ground and pinned him to the black board. Mr. P. could see that I was in bad shape, and one Friday in October he asked me if I had ever worked out with weights. I told him no.\n\nHe told me that I was going to take some\nof the money that I had saved and buy a hundred pound set of weights at Sears. As I left his office, I started to think of things I would say to him on Monday when he asked about the weights that I was not going to buy. Still, it made me feel special. My father never really got that close to caring. On Saturday I bought the weights, but I couldn’t even drag them to my mom’s car. An attendant laughed at me as he put them on a dolly.\n\nMonday came and I was called into Mr. P.’s office after school. He said that he was going to show me how to work out. He was going to put me on a program and start hitting me in the solar plexus in the hallway when I wasn’t looking. When I could take the punch we would know that we were getting somewhere. At no time\nwas I to look at myself in the mirror or tell anyone at school what I was doing. In the gym he showed me ten basic exercises. I paid more attention than I ever did in any of my classes. I didn’t want to blow it. I went home that night and started right in.\n\nWeeks passed, and every once in a while Mr. P. would give me a shot and drop me in the hallway, sending my books flying. The other students didn’t know what to think. More weeks passed, and I was steadily adding new weights to the bar. I could sense the power inside my body growing. I could feel it.\n\nRight before Christmas break I was walking to class, and from out of nowhere Mr. Pepperman appeared and gave me a shot in the chest. I laughed and kept going. He said I could look at myself now. I got home and ran to the bathroom and pulled off my shirt. I saw a body, not just the shell that housed my stomach and my heart. My biceps bulged. My chest had definition. I felt strong. It was the first time I can remember having a sense of myself. I had done something and no one could ever take it away.\n\nYou couldn’t say s–t to me.\n\nIt took me years to fully appreciate the value of the lessons I have learned from the Iron. I used to think that it was my adversary, that I was trying to lift that which does not want to be lifted. I was wrong. When the Iron doesn’t want to come off the mat, it’s the kindest thing it can do for you. If it flew up and went through the ceiling, it wouldn’t teach you anything. That’s the way the Iron talks to you. It tells you that the material you work with is that which you will come to resemble.\n\nThat which you work against will always work against you.\n\nIt wasn’t until my late twenties that I learned that by working out I had given myself a great gift. I learned that nothing good comes without work and a certain amount of pain. When I finish a set that leaves me shaking, I know more about myself. When something gets bad, I know it can’t be as bad as that workout.\n\nI used to fight the pain, but recently this became clear to me: pain is not my enemy; it is my call to greatness. But when dealing with the Iron, one must be careful to interpret the pain correctly. Most injuries involving the Iron come from ego. I once spent a few weeks lifting weight that my body wasn’t ready for and spent a few months not picking up anything heavier than a fork. Try to lift what you’re not prepared to and the Iron will teach you a little lesson in restraint and self-control.\n\nI have never met a truly strong person who didn’t have self-respect. I think a lot of inwardly and outwardly directed contempt passes itself off as self-respect: the idea of raising yourself by stepping on someone’s shoulders instead of doing it yourself. When I see guys working out for cosmetic reasons, I see vanity exposing them in the worst way, as cartoon characters, billboards for imbalance and insecurity. Strength reveals itself through character. It is the difference between bouncers who get off strong-arming people and Mr. Pepperman.\n\nMuscle mass does not always equal strength. Strength is kindness and sensitivity. Strength is understanding that your power is both physical and emotional. That it comes from the body and the mind. And the heart.\n\nYukio Mishima said that he could not entertain the idea of romance if he was not strong. Romance is such a strong and overwhelming passion, a weakened body cannot sustain it for long. I have some of my most romantic thoughts when I am with the Iron. Once I was in love with a woman. I thought about her the most when the pain from a workout was racing through my body.\n\nEverything in me wanted her. So much so that sex was only a fraction of my total desire. It was the single most intense love I have ever felt, but she lived far away and I didn’t see her very often. Working out was a healthy way of dealing with the loneliness. To this day, when I work out I usually listen to ballads.\n\nI prefer to work out alone.\n\nIt enables me to concentrate on the lessons that the Iron has for me. Learning about what you’re made of is always time well spent, and I have found no better teacher. The Iron had taught me\nhow to live. Life is capable of driving you out of your mind. The way it all comes down these days, it’s some kind of miracle if you’re not insane. People have become separated from their bodies. They are no longer whole.\n\nI see them move from their offices to their cars and on to their suburban homes. They stress out constantly, they lose sleep, they eat badly. And they behave badly. Their egos run wild; they become motivated by that which will eventually give them a massive stroke. They need the Iron Mind.\n\nThrough the years, I have combined meditation, action, and the Iron into a single strength. I believe that when the body is strong, the mind thinks strong thoughts. Time spent away from the Iron makes my mind degenerate. I wallow in a thick depression. My body shuts down my mind.\n\nThe Iron is the best antidepressant I have ever found. There is no better way to fight weakness than with strength. Once the mind and body have been awakened to their true potential, it’s impossible to turn back.\n\nThe Iron never lies to you. You can walk outside and listen to all kinds of talk, get told that you’re a god or a total bastard. The Iron will always kick you the real deal. The Iron is the great reference point, the all-knowing perspective giver. Always there like a beacon in the pitch black. I have found the Iron to be my greatest friend. It never freaks out on me, never runs. Friends may come and go. But two hundred pounds is always two hundred pounds.",

      "description": "# Nouns House #1 - Tokyo, Jpn\n\n## **v3 updated on 11/05/2023**\n\nThis proposal serves as an alternative to Proposal Candidate **[\"Nouns House DAO\"](https://nouns.wtf/candidates/0x1bde33dbc5c2ac7109c4a7ecf0d0a0a6cd6f57cc--nouns-house-dao)**, offering a **phased approach to establishing a new Nounish subDAO called Nouns House DAO**. It outlines the first steps which includes creating the first Nouns House and mobile app. As a second step, we plan to submit follow-up proposal by Feburary 2024 to transfer initial funding to the DAO treasury followed by successful execution of this proposal.\n\n**We have already established the Nouns House DAO multi-sig [treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0BC7181dc3863932F9b375bC348fe4A421B8003A), and all of the funding from this and future proposal will be going to the treasury.**\n\n***\n\n## TL;DR\n\nHello! I am **[tenichiliu.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/tenichiliu.eth)**, co-founder of Enabler DAO (**[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/enabler.fun/)**, **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/enablerofficial)**, **[Website](https://enablerdao.com/)**). Our decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) focuses on gathering, utilizing, managing, and improving idle assets like unused houses and cars within communities worldwide. My fellow co-founder at Enabler DAO, **[yukihamada.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/yukihamada.eth)**, is a holder of **[Noun 312](https://nouns.wtf/noun/312)**, and we believe in the power and potential of NounsDAO just as you do.\n\nWe are proposing a funding of **47,600 USDC** to give a Nounish makeover to a vacation rental property in Tokyo, Japan, valued over $1,000,000 USD. We intend to create “Nouns House #1” with this funding. Our property has already completed interior and exterior renovations; **all of the funding will be used for the Nounish makeover, and development of the mobile app.**\n\nBeyond just providing the property for Nouns House #1, **we will contribute 10% of the profits made from Nouns House #1 to the Nouns House DAO treasury for the first 5 years**. For future Nouns Houses real estates that are funded by the treasury, 100% of the profits will be returned to the treasury.\n\nIn alignment with NounsDAO’s CC0 philosophy, we will make all software and hardware implemented in this project open source. Furthermore, we plan to collaborate with the Nouns projects that are active in Japan such as **[pNouns](https://pnouns.wtf/en/)** (**[Noun 553](https://nouns.wtf/noun/553)**, **[Noun 556](https://nouns.wtf/noun/556)**) for events and promotions.\n\n**The diverse industry experience of our team will significantly contribute to the success of this project.** **[yukihamada.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/yukihamada.eth)** is a former executive CPO at Mercari, **[yukill.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/yukill.eth)** is a former CEO at ZOZO Technologies, **[Jiro](https://twitter.com/jiroisagame)** is a former YouTuber with 1.3 million subscribers, and I, **[tenichiliu.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/tenichiliu.eth)**, am a former engineer from Amazon Seattle.\n\nThis proposal was inspired by **[Nouns Deli](https://twitter.com/NounsDeli)**’s proposal (**[Proposal 254](https://nouns.wtf/vote/254)**, approved on 03/09/2023). Our next step is to establish a Nounish subDAO, called “Nouns House DAO”. Similar to the **[Nouns Builder Protocol](https://nouns.build/)** (**[Proposal 167](https://nouns.wtf/vote/167)**, approved on 11/12/2022), we aim to create a subDAO inheriting NounsDAO’s auction, treasury, and governance system. In the follow-up proposal, we plan to request initial funding for Nouns House DAO treasury, in order to create Nouns House #2 and subsequent Nouns Houses based on community decisions governed by the DAO.\n\n## 1.  Nouns House DAO ⌐◧-◧\n\nNouns House #1 created through this proposal will serve as the first Nouns House governed by Nouns House DAO. Following the successful execution of this proposal, we will submit a follow-up proposal to transfer initial funding to the Nouns House DAO treasury. This initial funding will be substantial enough to secure the purchase of the second Nouns House. The exact amount, along with detailed plans and specific property information, will be disclosed in this follow-up proposal. We believe that having initial funding in the treasury will create strong momentum for this new Nounish DAO.\n\nOur goal is to establish Nouns Houses in major cities globally, allowing individuals to experience Nouns art and culture. Additionally, we aim to **operate this as a profitable venture**, positioning Nouns House DAO as the pioneering Nounish subDAO that introduces a **3rd revenue pillar for the treasury, complementing the NFT auctioning and ETH staking.**\n\nNouns House DAO will oversee the operation and financial management of all Nouns Houses. **As a testament to our commitment, we will contribute 10% of the profits from Nouns House #1 to treasury for the first 5 years.** For all subsequent real estates that are funded by the Nouns House DAO treasury, 100% of the profits will be directed back to the treasury.\n\n![Bedroom](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1W23f_T6aANo9mXh9-lUu3bypKSzU12M4)\n\n## 2. Enabler DAO / Core Team ⌐◧-◧\n\nEnabler DAO is a asset sharing community that aims to facilitate easy sharing of large assets like houses and cars by leveraging blockchain and AI technology. As of November 2023, we operate 10 properties across 5 locations (Tokyo, Kyoto, Atami, Teshikaga, and Honolulu) in Japan and the United States. These properties are monetized through asset sharing within the community as well as through Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) such as Airbnb and Booking.com. Below are some of our properties and links to OTAs.\n\n🇯🇵 [**WHITE HOUSE Atami**](https://airbnb.com/h/white-house-atami\n) - Shizuoka, Japan\n🇯🇵 [**MACHIYA Kyoto**](https://www.kyoto-machiya-inn.com/accommodations/hanatoki/\n) - Kyoto, Japan\n🇯🇵 [**THE NEST Teshikaga**](https://airbnb.com/h/the-nest-teshikaga) - Hokkaido, Japan\n🇺🇸 [**BEACH HOUSE Honolulu**](https://airbnb.com/h/beach-house-honolulu-annex) - Hawaii, USA\n\n![Properties](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1C5UfxmK62s98QryMGZ_SoTIpED1fTUru)\n\nThe 4 founders of Enabler DAO are **[yukihamada.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/yukihamada.eth)** (**[Noun 312](https://nouns.wtf/noun/312)**), former executive CPO of Mercari; **[yukill.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/yukill.eth)**, former CEO at ZOZO Technologies & fund manager for MZ Web3 Fund; **[Jiro](https://twitter.com/jiroisagame)**, former YouTuber “Charisma Brothers” with 1.3 million subscribers & managing partner at iFund; and **[tenichiliu.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/tenichiliu.eth)**, a trilingual former Amazon HQ engineer with 5-years of experience. \n\nEnabler DAO was founded in October 2021, and we currently operate with about 10 DAO members. We have been operating highly successful and profitable vacation rental properties in multiple locations (10~20% annual ROI), and bring expertise in both rental operations and property management. Moreover, our diverse team brings a wide range of business and product development experience, combined with our strong track record, **I believe we are in a unique position to be successful at running the first Nouns House.**\n\n## **3. Nounish Makeover ⌐◧-◧**\n\nWe plan to transform our property in Aoyama, an upscale district in Tokyo, into \"Nouns House #1,\" with a Nounish makeover filled with art and goodies. \n\n![Living Room](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1bwo_xZOKns30glLVRyeoQ7ROKojrQkIE)\n\nAoyama is a hub of designer boutiques, art galleries, cafes, and shopping districts. It's not only a attracts for affluent individuals but also a popular tourist destination. Given the area's reputation and successful track record of our nearby properties, **we anticipate strong demand for high-end vacation rental property in Aoyama.**\n\n![Sauna](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1kabDge7tB6HDlZqn1fYccFdnsMt0-AdX)\n\nIn recent years, there has been a “sauna boom” in Japan. The number of sauna enthusiasts has been increasing due to heightened health consciousness and the proliferation of sauna facilities. In fact, the number of sauna users in Japan has increased by more than one million in the past year, and high-end sauna facilities in Tokyo are extremely popular. **We believe that Nouns House #1 will become widely popular within the sauna communities and beyond.**\n\n![Bath](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=190MOtkZF68sFwLUJzwbxoO4hNEtKDfch)\n\nThe artwork used for interior and exterior of Nouns House #1 will be directed by [amiyoko.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/amiyoko.eth) who have contributed many artwork to various Nouns projects such as NounsDAO Anniversary Art 2023 and Sushi Nouns.\n\n![Exterior](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1bESaiRK3zLewixG-8MvEEq9HgIhnkbqc)\n\nThe 1st floor is the sauna area, the 2nd floor features a living-dining-kitchen area, and the 3rd floor will be an office space and a bedroom. We aim to infuse each floor with Nounish elements while maintaining a sense of luxury in the interior design.\n\n![Chill](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1CvxZml-3RPmPaHxNUzN7yUE2DKu-wLyU)\n\n## 4. Marketing Efforts **⌐◧-◧**\n\nTo amplify the presence of Nouns House #1, **we will be forming a strategic partnership with a popular Japanese YouTuber group, [EvisJap](https://youtube.com/@EvisJap?si=6Oi6Ll6fIzis70ib).** With a subscriber base of 630,000, primarily young adults, they are known for their energetic travel blogs and lively social gatherings that resonate with the adventurous spirit of youth.\n\nDuring the weekdays, EvisJap will be utilizing Nouns House #1 as their recording studio, bringing a creative buzz to the space while providing regular exposure of Nouns to a broad audience through their videos. On weekends, Nouns House #1 will transform into an luxury private sauna. This dual-use approach optimizes the utility of the property, and exemplifies the innovative and adaptive spirit of the Nouns.\n\nThis collaboration, born from our unique relationship with EbisJap, is a synergy that offers exposure to Nouns House without direct marketing efforts. The value of this organic promotion is an example of the unique contribution that our team brings to the Nouns community.\n\n## **5. Mobile App ⌐◧-◧**\n\n**We will develop a mobile app for facilitating reservations and assigning maintenance work for Nouns House DAO**. This app will be powered by open-source framework called **[Skeet](https://skeet.dev/en/)** which seamlessly integrates with Google Cloud Platform and Firebase, making it easier to develop serverless full-stack applications. \n\nIt's worth noting that both Enabler and **[El Soul Labo](https://labo.elsoul.nl/en/)**, the team behind Skeet, received equity funding from **[East Ventures](https://east.vc/)**, one of the biggest venture capital fund in Asia. With the cutting edge Skeet framework and the invaluable support from the creator of Skeet, we can efficiently develop this app with just one engineer on our end.\n\nThe app will integrate with existing tools that offers API such as **[Beds24](https://beds24.com/)** for inventory management, **[Sesame Smart Lock](https://jp.candyhouse.co/)** for automatically issuing one-time guest keys, and **[Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-jp)** for fiat payment processing. In the interim, before our app release, we'll use **[LINE](https://line.me/en/)** and **[LINE Marketplace](https://line-marketplace.com/jp/app)** apps for chat-based reservation.\n\nFurthermore, we will incorporate web3 capabilities such as token-gating and cryptocurrency payment into the app. We plan to offer special coupons and priority reservations to Nouns House NFT holders, and allow payments in major cryptocurrencies.\n\n## **6. Utility Token ⌐◧-◧**\n\nWe plan to introduce a utility token which will be used for accessing Nouns House and can be earned through completing maintenance gigs listed in the app. **We envision some members of the Nouns House DAO to work maintenance gigs in order to earn the utility token.** We plan to use Solana chain for the token for 3 reasons: near-zero gas fees, rapid execution, and its integration with the user-friendly multi-chain wallet called Phantom. Enabler DAO has already been experimenting with Solana based utility token called [**EBR**](https://solscan.io/token/E1JxwaWRd8nw8vDdWMdqwdbXGBshqDcnTcinHzNMqg2Y) (available on [**Orca DEX**](https://v1.orca.so/liquidity/browse?tokenMint=E1JxwaWRd8nw8vDdWMdqwdbXGBshqDcnTcinHzNMqg2Y)) and have experience in this realm.\n\n## **7. Roadmap ⌐◧-◧**\n\nWe will begin the Nounish makeover and the development of mobile app, immediately following the approval of this proposal. In January 2024, we plan to pre-open Nouns House #1, followed by grand opening in February. Beta version of mobile app will be released in March, followed by production release in April. We will submit submit a follow-up proposal by Feburary 2024 to transfer initial funding for the DAO treasury followed by successful execution of this proposal.\n\n![Roadmap](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1xkl6xzFYEi-rAtpjmnARWpc34Pj_Dlh4)\n\n## **8. Budget ⌐◧-◧**\n\nWe are proposing **47,600 USDC funding for creating Nouns House #1 and to kick start the software infrastructure development for Nouns House DAO.** The Nounish makeover will cost $17,000, and the development of the mobile app will cost $30,600. All work will commence immediately upon the approval of the proposal.\n\n**Nouns House #1 Nounish Makeover: $17,000**\n- \"Nounish\" Exterior Wall Art: $6,000\n- \"Nounish\" Interior Art: $8,000\n- \"Nounish\" Goodies: $3,000\n\n**Mobile App (6-month development): $30,600**\n- Founding Engineer: $5,000/month\n- [Skeet](https://skeet.dev/en/) (Enterprise Support): $100/month\n\n## **9. Community Benefits ⌐◧-◧**\n\nThis proposal aims to **expand the Nouns community by creating the first \"Nouns House\", a network of properties where people can experience Nouns art and culture in major cities worldwide.**\n\nIn the next step, we will propose to transfer initial funding for Nouns House DAO treasury. This new Nounish subDAO will own Real World Asset (RWA) and operate them as a profit-making business. RWA is an area where the web3 industry is still struggling, and this new venture has the potential to significantly advance the industry on this front.\n\nNouns House NFT holders will be offered special perks such as discounted rates and priority access to Nouns Houses via token gating. Additionally, upon the funding of the Nouns House DAO treasury in our next proposal, **existing Nouns NFT holders can apply for Nouns House NFT airdrop by a pre-determined date**. This airdrop is optional and provides an opportunity for existing NounsDAO members to participate in the governance for Nouns House DAO without having to bid in the auction.\n\n## **10. CC0 ⌐◧-◧**\n\nWe believe, Nouns House’s CC0 culture will bring innovation to the real estate industry. While real estate design and architecture are generally not open-source, we will make all of these publicly available through our CC0 library. CC0 approach will also have a large impact on the vacation rental industry. **By providing tools to help achieve efficient operations, we will accelerate the automation and digital transformation of the vacation rental industry.** The interest and attention that this CC0 model will generate within these industries will serve as the ideal platform for spreading the culture and values of Nouns.\n\n## **11. Risks & Considerations ⌐◧-◧**\n\nWe are enthusiastic members of the Nouns community and, as Noun owner, strongly resonate with the vision of Nouns. **We believe that the Nouns model holds innovative power in asset management and vacation rental fields.** This decentralized, community-led governance model has the potential to offer new approaches in asset sharing and feels like the ideal way to manage assets in a decentralized manner. On the other hand, there are some risks considered in achieving the vision of this project:\n\n1. **Regulatory Risk**: Operating within a decentralized framework could potentially make the project subject to regulations. Compliance with local laws is crucial.\n2. **Technical Risk**: The integration of blockchain technology with physical assets like real estate presents several challenges. The implementation of smart contracts to manage the property must be executed flawlessly.\n3. **Community Engagement**: The strength of a DAO lies in its community. For long-term success, it's important to maintain community engagement and participation in governance.\n\nBy acknowledging these risks and proactively addressing them, we aim for the success of the Nouns House project.",

With the feedback provided, we have adjusted the time frame to a six-month period, in which we will showcase the impact of Nouns in YouTube.\n\n**PROOF OF WORK**\nFor the past 10 months, we have been producing non-stop Nouns-themed animated videos daily, and we are about to complete our first successful year. \nWe have created over 300 daily animated videos, with over 20 million views, 100,000 hours of watch time, 30,000 subscribers, and 5,900 comments. We have also generated over 800,000 views from YouTube remixes. **All of this has been done with no funding coming from the DAO.**\n\nOur team has self-funded all of our Nouns-themed animated video-work to date, demonstrating our commitment to Nouns DAO and our belief in its global potential.\n\n**OUR IMPACT**\nIn our first 2.5 Months (in which we created 73 videos in 73 days), we became the top subscribed Nouns Content YouTube Channel, rising from 0 subscribers to 1.1K!\nToday, 10 months in, we are currently at 33.8K subscribers on YouTube, a **30x** rise in subscribers. \n **All this work was accomplished without any funding from the DAO!**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/y1PVOsi.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IPa6eh8.png)\n*Today, we are the #1 most subscribed Nouns Channel in all of YouTube, and will be the first to cross the coveted 100,000 YouTube subscribers goal.*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/elw5VlT.png)\n\n**YOUTUBE STATS**\n⌐◨-◨  20+ MILLION VIEWS\n⌐◨-◨  [300+ Daily Animated Videos (in 3D!)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4MBWgNEwIAxi0Dbkbb1KDfP1c2qMfzOF)\n⌐◨-◨  100,000+ Hours of watch time\n⌐◨-◨  30,000+ Subscribers\n⌐◨-◨  5900+ Comments\n⌐◨-◨  800,000+ Views from Youtube Remixes\n\n**⌐◨-◨  20+ MILLION VIEWS**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pGzV1yz.jpg)\n*NounsLATAM's animated video content has gone viral, with our top three videos racking up over 15 million views combined.*\n\n\n**[⌐◨-◨  300+ Daily Animated Videos (in 3D!)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4MBWgNEwIAxi0Dbkbb1KDfP1c2qMfzOF)**\nAs a **two-person** video editor and graphic designer team with over 22 years of combined experience, we have consistently created these Nouns-themed animated 3D videos for the past 10 months, working **exclusively (and full time)** on this proposal. \n![](https://i.imgur.com/aTKTfU6.jpg)\n*Check out our process for making our daily animated 3D videos!*\n\n\n**⌐◨-◨  100,000+ Hours of watch time**\n ![](https://i.imgur.com/e72R4ZQ.png)\n***WE HAVE NEVER BOUGHT ADS**: 100,000 hours of organic watch time from people who really love our daily animated Nouns memes and stories, all in 3D!*\n\n\n\n**⌐◨-◨  30,000+ Subscribers**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gJ1qU2Q.png)\n*We began with zero subscribers and are about to cross 40,000.

To inspire community members to **leverage their networks** and create impactful proposals.\n2. Become an **enabler for Nouns community** to ease interactions with both well-established brands and non-crypto organizations.\n3. Showcase the **versatility** of Nouns' cc0 assets.\n\n**Strategy (Focus on long-term continuity):**\n- Use this Nouns Themed Playground as a monument that compliment the open-source design kit.  \n    - Showcase the design and instill trust in its playability.\n    - Distribute open-source design to at least 10 industry professionals and **incorporate** our Nouns themed play-structures **in their product catalogs**\n    - Expand Nouns network value and **boost adoption** of Nouns themed play-structures.\n    - Scale Nouns themed play-structures organically\n- Submit this Nouns Themed Playground project to architecture platform like [ArcDaily](https://www.archdaily.com/); to **gain attention from new audience** into Nouns.\n*(we are already in contact with ArcDaily CN curator)*\n    - Open-source design kit will be uploaded but not limited to: github, cco-library, platform like Arcdaily, Bimstore, etc.\n    - Allowing anyone who can build it in their region to plug and build easily.\n- Apart from a **high quality documentary** to tell our story, we will also leverage on media partners.\n    - Sharing BTS footage as short format videos, to **rally attention,** **enhance curiosity**, bringing fans along on this journey, as we show progression and erect our first Nouns Themed Playground.\n        - Content will be shared on but not limited to: X, Farcaster, IG, Tiktok, Youtube, Little Red Book, etc.\n        - New fans are also able to ask questions about Nouns along this journey.\n    - Prop progression will also be shared and updated timely on [Propdates.wtf](https://www.propdates.wtf/)\n\n## **Nouns Themed Play-Structures**\nOn top of the initial batch of play-structures, we will also identify **additional 4 Nouns characters** with the design team. These will also be created into play structures and release as part of our open-source design kit, to provide a more **diverse range** of play options which would help boost adoption.    \n\nBelow are the initial batch of play-structure design:\n![PvesMIo.png](https://i.imgur.com/PvesMIo.png)\n![fixz9u4.png](https://i.imgur.com/fixz9u4.png)\n![YkWRXSB.png](https://i.imgur.com/YkWRXSB.png)\n![djZZ0Ad.png](https://i.imgur.com/djZZ0Ad.png)\n\n![iUgJbGz.png](https://i.imgur.com/iUgJbGz.png)\n![gkAgf1V.png](https://i.imgur.com/gkAgf1V.png)\n\n![plrxaMQ.png](https://i.imgur.com/plrxaMQ.png)\n\n![nnoE35D.png](https://i.imgur.com/nnoE35D.png)\n![1ntFyVf.png](https://i.imgur.com/1ntFyVf.png)\n![Z0XcwVm.png](https://i.imgur.com/Z0XcwVm.png)\n![TOfLCiK.png](https://i.imgur.com/TOfLCiK.png)\n![6B1HsP6.png](https://i.imgur.com/6B1HsP6.png)\n![FAesqnE.png](https://i.imgur.com/FAesqnE.png)\n\n\n### **Site Visual**\n![pPKg3fq.png](https://i.imgur.com/pPKg3fq.png)\n![RyDHDCm.png](https://i.imgur.com/RyDHDCm.png)\n\n## **FAQ:**\n**1. Is this playground open to public?**\nYes! This will be a public playground that is accessible to everyone; a large scale tangible Nounish public good.\n\n**2. Is the land for the themed playground secured?**\nYes! We have secured a 2000sqm plot of land beside Element 6 to construct this themed playground.\n\n**3. What is Element 6?**\nElement 6, located in Guangzhou, is a recreational hub with a diverse range of indoor and outdoor activities, include but not limited to go-karting, rock climbing, surf simulator and more; drawing an average monthly footfall of 800,000 visitors. It operates as a subsidiary under the XiangNeng Investment conglomerate.\n\n*Click on the image below to watch their introduction.*\n[![804iyWZ.png](https://i.imgur.com/804iyWZ.png)](https://youtu.be/IlRq1ZJtYPA)\n**4. Are there any liability concerns?**\nLiabilities are covered under Element 6's insurance that enveloped both indoor and outdoor activities.\n\n**5. Will we encounter any permit issues?**\nElement 6 owns the land and it is commercially zoned, where the proposed construction work aligns with zoning regulations. We've also conducted due diligence, including consulting with the authorities, and received verbal approval thus, we are confidence in obtaining the final official approval in a timely manner.\n\n**6. Can this prop be done in phases?**\nProgressing in phases to protect the DAO's interest is an ideal approach; however, the land allocation offered to us isn't available in perpetual for gradual proposals process. Therefore, we've structured the funding in a manner that allow us to commit to this project with an initial release, while the rest is released via stream as we progress, which the DAO can halt if any unforeseen issues arise.\n\n**7. Why not just fund the design of the play-structures?**\nFunding open-source product is Nounish; however, it's wasteful without utilization, and its impact is diminished in the absence of (in this case) tangible play-structure to showcase actual playability and potential. The physical Nouns Themed Playground would help facilitate the propagation of such reusable components to other location & industry professionals with greater effectiveness.\n\n**8. How is this prop scalable?**\nPlayground equipment had a market share of $4.91 billion in 2022, with a projected increase to $9.65 billion by 2030, reflecting a 7% CAGR from 2023 to 2030. This highlights a linear growth in this market.\n\nThe physical Nouns themed playground would allow us to showcase and build trust with industry professionals, allowing us to share our open-source designs with them, to have them integrate Nouns themed play-structures into their product catalogs confidently. We are able to promote open-source while at the same time allowing us to **leverage on their clientele and this growing market, boosting adoption** of Nouns themed play-structures in playgrounds worldwide, given the preference for catalog-based designs by most clients.\n\n\nFurthermore, anyone, especially builders in Nouns community can also use this activation as a monument to ease interaction with their local town that do not have playground or intent to build a playground, to eventually plug and build a Nouns Themed Playground using the open-source design.\n \n## **Budget**\n\n**[UPDATE]**\n*We've secured a new contractor for the design and fabrication of our Nouns themed play-structure, reducing cost by 12%.*\n\n### **Allocation**\nThe total proposed budget is **594,850 USD** for 6mths duration, with an allocation as follows:\n\n**1. Construction: 522,850 USDC**\n* Immediate release: **200,000 USDC**\n* Remaining via *Stream 1*: **80,712.5 x 4 = 322,850 USDC**\n     \n**2. Team Compensation: 72,000 USDC**\n* Immediate release: **24,000 USDC**\n* Remaining via *Stream 2/3*: **(6,000 x 2pax) x 4 = 48,000 USDC**\n   \n**Total Immediate release: 224,000 USDC**\n**Total Stream over 4mths: 370,850 USDC**\n\n*Stream start 1st Jan'24 - End 30th Apr'24*\n![LLUSxWp.png](https://i.imgur.com/LLUSxWp.png)\n### **Breakdown**\n![Hq53eOk.png](https://i.imgur.com/Hq53eOk.png)\n### **Timeline**\n![lvDlVh4.png](https://i.imgur.com/lvDlVh4.png)\n\n## **Who we are!**\nFor Nouns community who do not know who we are, allow us to introduce ourselves.\n\n![JSehkp9.gif](https://i.imgur.com/JSehkp9.gif)\n\nWe are [Karl (Nouncil)](https://twitter.com/WideEyeKarI) and [Nic (Noun74)](https://twitter.com/noun_74) & we've been active with Nouns since Jul 2022.\nWe have:\n\n- brought Nouns presence into China with IRL activation at [Shanghai](https://twitter.com/Nounscn/status/1640922970330738688), [Beijing](https://twitter.com/Nounscn/status/1663381928278409218), [ChengDu](https://twitter.com/Nounscn/status/1672628395300257793) as well as [Singapore](https://twitter.com/nounsinsg/status/1567474695536283650)\n- created [\"Nogge chair\"](https://twitter.com/Nounscn/status/1641044874358304768) which is at Himalayas Art Museum as a public infrastructure\n- release free to collect Nouns digital collectables with [Shina Weibo](https://twitter.com/Nounscn/status/1648670544404025344)\n- organized [art contest](https://twitter.com/Nounscn/status/1658012368063062016) allowing more Chinese artist to get exposure to Nouns\n- assisted local cafe in Beijing in putting up a [Nouns mural](https://twitter.com/Nounscn/status/1667187943709245440)\n- onboarded local animator to create a [short shorts for Nouns](https://twitter.com/Nounscn/status/1681867478887202817) (releasing soon)\n- facilitated the [inclusion of Nouns into a web3 introduction book](https://twitter.com/Nounscn/status/1675778263678070787) which is available at bookstores throughout China\n- onboarded award winning music producer Hanjin Tan, who will be debuting \"Noggle Chair\" in his [musical theatre show in HongKong](https://twitter.com/Nounscn/status/1719904562239471814)\n- created a [Nouns statue serving as a public good infrastructure (signage)](https://twitter.com/Nounscn/status/1708330846275682776) at Mount Liupian, Guangzhou\n- worked on various IRL charitable public good activations, including [nounifying a local autism school](https://twitter.com/nounsinsg/status/1585995683168821248), [Nounish Holiday Season](https://twitter.com/nounsinsg/status/1606688371119915008)\n- kick started green initiative public good activation in the form of [beach clean up](https://twitter.com/nounsinsg/status/1559183156887990273) which spark a [clean up contest by TNS](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare/status/1560882911100174336) that eventually started [Nouns Africa](https://twitter.com/davinoyesigye/status/1562433784922148864)\n- assisted byWassies in creating our very [first Nouns themed hotel room](https://twitter.com/WideEyeKarI/status/1632224927763042305)\n\nBeyond our involvement in Web 3, both of us possess over a decade experience in project management.

          "reason": "After speaking with Karl about the proposal and addressing my concerns about splitting the proposal up into the two phases (design & build) He alleviated those by explaining that they did all the due diligence to get the land ready for building out the playground ahead of time and that just doing the design wouldn't guarantee they have the land in the future. Also, if any issues come up during development, the dao has control over the streamed payments and can end it, if progress isn't being made. I personally think that this was a very carefully thought out and well designed proposal that is worth executing on. They have done significant work ahead of any funding to get it to where it is today and thats worth consideration. Some people may not like the current designs, but the team is willing to work and get feedback to make the play structures look/feel good. \n\nPls listen to the Tavern for our conversation: https://alpha.tavern.fm/taverns/8oJLjKWddfQC4op68ezr",

The more crucial question we ask ourselves is the rate of adoption with these designs (cc0 assets) alone. How impactful will it be without a physical playground that is enjoyed by everyone to support it? Take the example of Nouns movie—considering impact versus cost, would funding only the creation of characters as cc0 assets be as impactful as funding the development of a complete Nouns movie? What would be the adoption rate for these assets if we rely on animation houses to pick them up, compared to having a fully realized Nouns movie that showcases the potential of Nounish animated characters, inherently cc0 in nature to boost adoption? The same principles apply to Nouns themed play-structures.\n\n+1 prof \nBeyond the build, our goal is to drive/boost adoption, encouraging other industry professionals to utilize cc0 Nouns themed play-structures, thereby sparking a Nounish playground market/network.

      "description": "# Bright Any Colors with ⌐◨-◨ Noggles Jack Events\n\n# Bright Any Colors with ⌐◨-◨ Noggles Jack Events\n\n![](https://eibakatsu.com/bac/1.png)\n\n## TL;DR\n- “Bright Any Colors” embodies the meaning that every individual shines to their potential.\n\n- We will be hosting a charity event “Bright Any Colors with ⌐◨-◨” will be held for the first time at a closed elementary school in Nagoya on Saturday, December 23, 2023.\nThis event is a networking event where we discuss the role of technology in an era of “pluralism” with participants. People involved in seemingly different fields, such as social contribution organizations and the web3 community, will gather together with the aim of creating new support and revenue methods that combine social problem solving and web3.\n\n- Simultaneously with the charity event, we will be hosting “Noggles Jack Nagoya” and the “web3 Community Exhibition,” expecting over 1,000 attendees. In line with the event, there will be talk sessions, Nouns' booths, workshops, promotional merchandise distributions, and planned social contribution activities.\n\n- Prior to the event, we will have a booth for Nouns at the Design Festa in Tokyo on Sunday, November 12, 2023. Following our previous Proposal 228 “Noggles Jack Tokyo,” this will be our second event where we will display and sell Nouns merchandise. Moreover, we will also be promoting “Bright Any Colors with ⌐◨-◨.”\n\n## Background & Challenges\n- While individuals possess various facets, society often fails to accept them, because it's easier to manage by measuring everyone against a uniform set of values, leading to a tendency to avoid complexity.\nI believe that the biggest societal issue lies in the attempt to oversimplify intricate matters. Many people in today's society are bound by existing frameworks, having forgotten how to create new concepts and systems on their own accord.\n\n- The utilization of web3 technology for societal transformation is in an trial phase, but leveraging Nouns' autonomous decentralized system has the potential to assist.\nThere's a need for support towards technology that encourages “pluralistic” decision-making and collaboration, as well as the activities that accompany it.\n\n- In October 2022, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities pointed out that Japan's education for persons with disabilities is lagging behind and made [recommendations.](https://docstore.ohchr.org/SelfServices/FilesHandler.ashx?enc=6QkG1d%2FPPRiCAqhKb7yhsox6sZe%2Fik6d3iDJzISRPhvIaActFR9I%2FAIZ%2Be8dEYc3x9pGI%2BAqnUjiYnhf%2BzLRJLqW2mBzZdcaW0%2B10tvwrA97qOnmCuV89Qwl7dhkmc1B) However, there has been still no progress in understanding and awareness of disabilities, and the separation of special needs education from regular classes has been seen as a problem.\nFurthermore, research and studies on rare and congenital diseases are struggling due to the influence of market principles and an emphasis on efficiency.\n\n- “Bright Any Colors” is aimed at supporting individuals with disabilities, children, and students. Participants will be able to exchange opinions within the event, increasing the potential for new ideas and solutions to emerge.\n\n## Theme & Objectives\n“Bright Any Colors with ⌐◨-◨” aims to enjoyably learn about DAOs through Nouns, aspiring to pave the way for a future where everyone shines their brightest. Our passion for enhancing the lives of all resonates with the public, and we've designed this event hoping that the concepts and systems of web3 naturally gain broader recognition. Relying on the insights and experiences from this endeavor, we will continuously engage in activities that leverage web3 technology to address societal challenges. We will host events 3-4 times a year, striving for widespread awareness and education.\n\n## Event Overview\n### Dec 23, 2023 Event & Workshop\n![](https://eibakatsu.com/bac/2.png)\n\n- **A talk session will be held on the stage of the gymnasium.**\nOur special guests for this event will be Ms. Chizuru Azuma, an actor who has been actively involved in social contribution activities for over 30 years, and Mr. paji, a research expert in DAO and Co-Planner at pNouns.\nThe theme will be an explanation of the full-fledged DAO \"Nouns\" and its applicability to social issues.\n　\nFor example…the funding mechanism by Nouns DAO What is \"Treasury Wallet\"?\nWe'll introduce its structure, potential applications, and other real-life examples, all tailored for beginners.\nNouns-related images and videos will be projected using a projector into the visual stage production.\n\n- **Booth exhibition by social contribution organizations.**\nWe will introduce initiatives by organizations supporting people with disabilities, children, and students, as well as employment support facilities, as well as sell products and conduct educational activities.\n\n- **Invited event company \"NFT COLOR\" together the actively active web3 community in Japan Exhibiting NFT art works,** introducing the community, and interacting with social contribution organizations.\n\n### Event Proposal\n#### Various Workshops\n![](https://eibakatsu.com/bac/3.png)\n\nMs. Chizuru Azuma is in charge of the planning, composition, casting, direction, costume design, and overall supervision of the [“MAZEKOZE Island Tour,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waK22pnvFRY) which is being streamed worldwide as one of the events of the “Tokyo 2020 NIPPON Festival.”\n\n[Using the theatrical arts to create a more diverse society](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8c-CycBt0M) | Chizuru Azuma | TEDxKyoto\n\n### Location\n#### Nagono Campus\n![](https://eibakatsu.com/bac/4.png)\n[\"Nagono Campus\"](https://nagono-campus.jp/englishguide/) is located in Nagoya City, Aichi Prefecture.\n\n### Phase\n![](https://eibakatsu.com/bac/5.png)\n\n### Advatages of simultaneous event in Tokyo and Nagoya\n![](https://eibakatsu.com/bac/6.png)\n\nAt the event \"Noggles Jack Tokyo\" held on May 20th and 21st, 2023, Nouns became widely known to the general public through Noggles.\nAt the charity event \"Bright Any Colors with ⌐◨-◨,\" we will set up a \"Noggles Jack Nagoya\" booth.\nJust like last time, attendees can enjoy Nouns characters and Noggles. Furthermore, this time we will introduce beginners to the concept and system of Nouns DAO, conveying its intrinsic appeal.\nWe will also introduce several active Nouns communities in Japan, offering a space where attendees can feel more connected and familiar with them.\nFurthermore, at \"Noggles Jack Tokyo2,\" we will once again meet many people in Japan's capital, Tokyo, and raise awareness for the charity event we plan to hold in the near future.\n\nThank you for the funding provided by Nouns for [\"Noggles Jack Tokyo\"](https://twitter.com/pNounsOFFICIAL/status/1665346115636727808) (Proposal 228).\n\n![](https://eibakatsu.com/bac/7.png)\n![](https://eibakatsu.com/bac/8.png)\n\n#### pNouns New Initiative.

      "description": "# LET’S GET MAD (Meme Analysis Database + Proposer Pipeline Analytics)\n\n---\n\n*“Is Nouns activity growing?” “Who is helping increase engagement and spreading the meme?” “Which proposals are driving growth?” “What’s our spend rate?” “How many builders are contributing to the Nouns ecosystem?” “Are the amount of proposal candidates increasing?”*\n\n## **TL;DR**\n\nThere are a lot of questions that the Nouns community needs data support on. We want to create a database that helps anyone answer these questions, and an example website on top to support a first analysis: *What is the proposer pipeline and how can Nouns best support builders?*\n\nThe database will integrate activity across social channels and highlight which Nouns, advocates, and proposals have best supported the Noun’s meme propagation. Our data wrangling creative motto is: *Track Memes, Not (just) People.*\n\nAs a starting point, this work will gather the following data: [1] **onchain** activity (supported by the Nouns subgraph) and [2] two sources of social media (**Farcaster** and **Instagram**). This data will be available for others to query and use to investigate additional questions.\n\nWithin the scope of the work, we will also create a basic website including [3] a limited set of **general metrics** for context, and [4] **the first analysis website** focusing on the specific challenge of understanding the proposal conversion process. In this way, we will be the first “app analysis” built on the dataset.\n\n## Background\n\nAs of the moment, the Nouns’ community and audience members produce a wide variety of data. Over time, more data is likely to migrate onchain (e.g. similar to vote comments today) and data will be produced across even more digital localities. The *United World of Nouns* will have a wide-ranging data footprint. Combining data across these localities can become a powerful tool for proposal development and decision-making.\n\nHowever, as @Krel mentioned in their [Request for Proposers](https://www.notion.so/94dadff999ac493b9902aa002e4b296e?pvs=21):\n\n> *“Nouns DAO does not have a reliable way to measure ‘growth’ or ‘success’. Its not clear what should be measured, or what growth in the context of Nouns even means.”*\n> \n\nThis project will create an initial repository of activity growth combining onchain and offchain data. We are long overdue to experiment on this front!\n\n## Scope Overview\n\nThe Noun Pulse has two components: \n\n- [A] the open database and\n- [B] a single-purpose website with general metrics and a first analysis\n\nIn addition, we will include an analysis report explaining current trends, issues, and opportunities in the proposer pipeline.\n\nTo begin, we will include onchain data available in the Nouns Subgraph and two social media channels: Farcaster and Instagram. We will then publish a selection of core metrics that provide clarity to Noun holders and the wider community.\n\nMost importantly, the underlying data pool (Meme Activity Database) will serve a step towards a data-driven Nouns culture, which community members and potential builders can use to find opportunities for proposal submissions. This should enable builders to bypass building a new database. Instead, we can amend it, expand it, or fork it. As a result, we can focus our energy on answering new business questions.\n\nSuccess of this project will be measured based on **data pool connections** (e.g. external usage of the Meme Activity Database), **web usage** (unique visitors), and **discussions** or proposals that successfully reference the data.\n\nThis work will enable future analysis to include key derivative NFT projects (Gnars, LilNouns, cc0-lib) and other dominant social spaces (Discord, Discourse, X, Lens, etc).\n\n## Product Components\n\n![Components (1).png](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkelSB-7p.png)\n\n### Meme Activity Database (a.k.a. The MAD)\n\nWe’ve named the database the “Meme Activity Database.” The reason is that we don’t want to just track people; we want to track *********************************the content*********************************. Our ambition is that this database is an MVP aggregation of all-things Nouns, reliable **meme-data-as-a-service,** such that we can service a variety of new data-powered projects.\n\nAs mentioned, this database will be open source and free access: anyone should be able to contribute to it (e.g. add a new source or table) and build on top of that.\n\nAt the end of the day, we want to facilitate the use of data across the Nouns ecosystem. As the cc0 library enables media usage, the activity database enables tracking and impact analysis.\n\nThe Web API interface will be available publicly  distributed per specific sources (onchain Nouns, Farcaster, and others) as well as in aggregated form to enable the development of tools such as alerts, bots, and analytics dashboards.\n\nData will be synchronized in real-time directly from the Nouns’ Subgraph, Farcaster, Instagram to an SQL database. The sync mechanism will be architected in a uniform adapter interface for easier future integration with other onchain data and offchain sources, such as Twitter, Discourse, Discord, Telegram, DeSo, and Lens.\n\n## The Noun Pulse Website: General Metrics\n\nWe believe that many Noun community members have a variety of needs. We will supply an overview of general metrics to serve as a source of truth for conversations.\n\nThese include:\n\n**Example Onchain Metrics, Supporting Clarity on Arbitrage**\n\n- Treasury\n- Treasury Usage Rate (Monthly Spend)\n- Burn Value\n- Estimated Burn Value at Next Fork\n- Average Auction Price\n- Current Arbitrage Opportunity (3-day average auction price minus value at next fork)\n- Count of Unique Holders\n- Count of Active Holders (Unique Holders with Vote w/ Reason in past 30 days)\n\n**Example Proposer Pipeline Metrics, Supporting Clarity in Builder Ecosystem**\n\n- Proposer Pipeline (with addresses and available contact information, details in next section)\n- Conversion Rates from Stage to Stage\n- Excerpts of Builder Stories\n- Count of Prop House Submissions\n- Count and % of Prop House Submissions from New Builders\n- Count and % of Passes Prop House Submissions\n- Count of Candidates\n- Count and % of Candidates from New Builders\n- Count and % of Candidates converting to Onchain Proposals\n- Count of Proposals\n- Count and % of Proposals from New Builders\n- Count and % of Passed Proposals\n- Count of Unique Proposers\n- Count of Unique Funded Builders\n- Growth in Onchain Comments\n    - Growth in Candidate Feedback\n    - Growth in Prop Vote with Reason\n    - Growth in Prop Updates\n\n**Example Offchain Metrics, Supporting Clarity in Nouns Reach**\n\n- Number of Posts\n- Total Engagement (Likes+Comments+Shares)\n- Engagement Rate (Ratio of Engagement to Posts)\n- Most Engaged Content\n- Total Followers\n- Total Followers with Onchain Identity\n- Follower Growth Rate (Updated based on API opportunity)\n\n***Representative Image of General Metrics***\n\nThe design for the website will use assets from the cc0 library and default Noun design parameters from the main website noun.wtf\n\n![Screenshot 2023-11-02 at 16.52.43.png](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyTCrHWm6.png)\n\n## Alpha Analysis Report: The Proposer Pipeline\n\nThe first iteration of the database will be focused to help address a key opportunity in the Nouns DAO: **attracting, shepherding, and retaining quality builders**. The data we select and analyze will be guided by this problem statement.\n\n### **Analysis Context and Design**\n\nEvery DAO has a funnel of builder activity. In the case of Nouns, we can roughly organize the participation process as:\n\n![Proposer Journey Graphic (1).png](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H10ZHHWQT.png)\n\n1. Aware (Saw Nouns)\n2. Curious (Engaged with Nouns, Offchain)\n3. Audience (Engaged with Nouns, Onchain)\n4. Voter (Vote with Reason)\n5. Prop House Submitter (Submitted to the Garden)\n6. Prop House Funded (Proposal Passed)\n7. Candidate (Submitted Candidate Proposal)\n8. Onchain Proposer (Submitted Onchain Proposal)\n9. Funded Builder (Proposal Passed)\n10. Committed Builder (Completed Proposal)\n11. Multi-Proposal Builder (Multiple Proposals Passed)\n\n---\n\nHowever, we currently don’t have clarity on the people involved throughout this proposal process, or where Nouns can focus on to coach builders and retain them. \n\nAs Noun40 describes in this proposal’s feedback, there are many open questions. \n\nSome of ours include:\n\n- How many of the candidate props are from net new ppl?\n- Of the net new ppl, do their candidate props grow to be full props that pass (success cases)\n- How did those prop builders find us? (number will be so small you could just ask them)\n    - *Note: We will document stories where data is not available*\n- What is the number of ppl that commented on the candidate proposal?\n- Is that quantity and participant of candidate feedback growing?\n- Are prop house builders in the garden round then submitting candidate proposals? If not, why?\n- Are builders returning to submit new proposals? If not, why?\n\nAt the end of the day, ***“we want more net new quality prop builders and we want them to have success and a low drop off rate.” (Noun40)***\n\nOur team would add: **we want those quality builders to come back.**\n\n---\n\nUsing this framework as a starting point, we can analyze the data, create different visuals, and validate the journey hypothesis. We understand this may not be trivial and some data or identity mapping may not be available. Data will be complimented with builder stories.\n\n![Screenshot 2023-11-02 at 16.50.42.png](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJFvSrbXT.png)\n\n### **Analysis Considerations**\n\nAs part of the deliverable, we will also include documented business rules underlying the analysis. For example, we will include what means if a builder is net-new. This is not necessarily trivial since we want to avoid counting an ethereum address as “net-new” if it’s the same builder but submitting an application with a new ethereum address.\n\nEach of these business rules will be discussed openly throughout the work to ensure the Noun community has opportunity to provide feedback.\n\n### **Analysis Outputs: A Written Report**\n\nCreating graphs and metrics is not enough for action. As a result, the scope of the analysis will include a **written report (In Notion or similar)** with recommendations. \n\nThe intention is to test out the usefulness of the database and the website — to build for action. In this case, we will understand where the proposer pipeline issues are, support them with data, and provide tangible advice. \n\nFor example, insights may include ways to identify potential builders earlier, and help them find a Noun-sponsor prior to a candidate proposal submission; imagine if another group of Nouns community members (not just holders), offered to shepherd builders in the proposal process, similar to gardeners. \n\nThese insights will be framed as RFPs (**Request for Proposals**), such that the Nouns community has clearer direction on where to invest to strengthen the proposer pipeline.\n\n## Product Roadmap\n\nThe execution of this project will be done in an iterative fashion. By building in public and getting ongoing feedback, we can deliver what the community needs, and data that will support Nouns decisions.\n\n**Iterative Phases:**\n\n- **Phase 1:** Deliver alpha analysis plan outline and approach. Deliver mock-up UI for web application. Deliver database raw data components and MVP. Host open Q&A with Nouns (e.g. via Aburra) to gather community feedback.\n- **Phase 2:** Deliver basic UI w/ metrics. Deliver initial list of insights from analysis. Provide update on database. Host open Q&A (e.g. via Aburra) to gather community feedback.\n- **Phase 3:** Deliver UI updates. Deliver builder stories. Provide demo of database queries. Host open Q&A (e.g. via Aburra) to gather community feedback.\n- **Phase 4:** Complete UI polishing and metrics calibration. Host open Q&A (e.g. via Aburra) to celebrate launch and discuss future analytics (where next?).\n\n## An Ambitious Vision\n\nThis project aims to uncover what “Nouns-Native” analytics could look like, and what data infrastructure is necessary to feed this analytics into the broader Nouns governance and participation process.\n\nWe’re certain there will be other innovations along the way. After all, we need to address challenges in crossing the web3-to-web2 data pipeline chasm. Is it possible? We think so.\n\nFortunately, the team is not alone. They have a wide array of connections with governance leaders across the DAO space: Optimism, Purple, Forefront, Radworks, SeedClub, FWB, Cabin, and others.\n\nNouns is a place for ambitious ideas, and we are an ambitious team.\n\n## Team\n\nThis project will be led and executed by Rafa Fernandez (Farcaster: @rafa) and Rafi Gutkowski (Farcaster: @rafi). \n\n- Rafa Fernandez is a community architect with a focus on building [Digital Public Utilities](https://www.notion.so/General-Networks-e4615b9b52294f8bab34a82b47023d11?pvs=21). He has decade of experience in corporate analytics and studied materials-science and engineering. He is the founder of Folklore (Folklore.Institute), a community that curates and commissions research on digital cultures. Most recently, he was part of the Summer of Protocols research program looking at [online swarms](https://www.notion.so/41c114211ac045f087c44c16bd993748?pvs=21). Previous to the program he worked at Mirror where he worked in creator partnerships and community development.\n- Rafi Gutkowski is a software engineer and data scientist ([libred.org](https://libred.org/), [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/rgutkowski)). He is building [Farway](http://farway.org), a Farcaster meta-client for social analytics. He started mining bitcoin in 2015 but only after exiting from his recent startup, did he double down on web3. Since then Rafi has been working on sementic analysis of decentralized social graphs, as well as creating web3-web2 bridges, such as Folklore’s web3-signature to feed [broadcast applet](https://www.notion.so/Folklore-5d34757913064064b87119c4593eda74?pvs=21).\n\n## Funding\n\nWe are a stream of 22.5 ETH to fund this project over 10 weeks.\n\nThe funds will be allocated to a two-person team (Rafa and Rafi). They are split roughly 25-75 between planning and iterative engineering. There is about a 40-40-10 between data engineering, analysis + visuals, and handoff. There is approximately 10% reserved for bugs and issue resolution.\n\nWe expect that once the initial traunch of data engineering and visuals is complete, then we can make a decision on what the community needs more of (if anything), such as expanded data, or expanded analysis\n\n## Our Commitments\n\n- We commit to posting updates on [updates.wtf](https://updates.wtf/) with sprint plan and outcomes, in alignment with each of the community Q&A feedback sessions.\n- We commit to cancelling the stream based on community feedback.\n- We commit to executing this work as an open-source project, such that other onchain communities and organizations can benefit.\n\n## Other Notes\n\nThis proposal was built based on the Basic Nouns Proposal Template, built by Rafa and available here: https://hackmd.io/@rafathebuilder/BkPAmHZbp\n\nIf you’d like to learn more about this proposal, the first Q&A conversation on Aburra is available here: https://youtu.be/_dr2yZulMGU",

      "description": "# NounsWatch: Nouns Iconic cc0 Timepieces ⌐◨-◨ ⌚ (V2)\n\n# \n\n# tldr\n1. **Why funding a NounsWatch?**\n    - **Cultural Capital**: In the digital age, physical products with a cultural and fashion statement become powerful tools of social reach and influence. They serve as “physical memes,\" carrying the DAO's brand and ideals into new spaces.\n    - **Leveraging Existing Success**: Building upon the memetical success of the sunglasses, the NounsWatch diversifies the DAO's brand to new places and moments, making it more resilient and future proof.\n    - **Broader Audience**: This opens up the growing fashion watch market and audiences in numbers never reached before.\n    - **Revenue Share**: With a 10% return of sales revenue to the DAO's treasury, the NounsWatch contributes to the much need flywheel spin.\n    - **Open Source Legacy**: By making the blueprints and digital models public domain (CC0), the project stands to benefit the broader community, true to NounsDAO open-source nature.\n2. **What is the NounsDAO funding covering?**\n    - The partially done product development.\n    - The minimum order quantity of 1000 watches (Dwiss will cover overproduction)\n    - The launch campaign.\n    - The team compensation ensuring the project’s success from inception to market.\n3. **What is the Go-to-Market Strategy?**\n    - Position the NounsWatch collection in the prominent affordable fashion watch segment.\n    - Run a Pre-sale discount Drop on Indiegogo massive 10 million people audience.\n    - Continue selling on Shopify.\n    - Run Influence Marketing and User Generated Content campaigns.\n    - Keep on building.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qj6bN2J.png)\n\n# A new hero product for Nouns\n\nThe NounsWatch serves as a new, tangible interface for the Nouns brand. Designed to be worn day and night, it reaches places that the Noggles glasses can't. This watch represents a powerful demonstration of what the Nouns community can achieve, extending the brand's narrative into an entirely new realm of self-expression. It seamlessly combines nounishness and horology, on the verge of becoming **the most personal and novel product Nouns has ever created**.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PleFEx9.png)\n## The NounsWatch cc0 design: accessible to everyone\n\nCreated by renowned watch designer Rafael Miranda, the bold Noggle-inspired design is **half a watch and half a ⌐◨-◨**, literally. And like all nounish things should be, it’s cc0!\n\n\n\nIt's as much about functionality as it is about meticulous attention to detail. It features an exquisite *mysterious hours* full day half display, with a glass mirror and a black dial. The hour and minute handles are individual pieces that combines every hour to form the Noggles symbol. On the NounsWatch, **every hour is Noun O'Clock!**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NC00WLn.gif)\n\n## The most personal Nouns product yet\n\nExplore a diverse range of personalization options with the interchangeable straps. Choose from 8 solid colors for the body and straps, or select one of the 8 available Nouns Accessory-themed straps. With 128 unique combinations, the NounsWatch will fits various styles.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9ptDzga.png)\n\n## First Prototypes\n\nTo demonstrate our unwavering commitment to the project, not only have we developed two 3D-printed prototypes, as shown below, but we've also field-tested the product for comfort and fit on the wrists. Just imagine how stunning these will look when adorned with the final production finish and colorful straps! Watch the prototype live in video: [here](https://x.com/rsmiranda/status/1714557390241059120?s=20) and [here.](https://x.com/fabioseva/status/1714901327631843711?s=46&t=OnA_W289RIsplarDuhpSrg)\nNote: The current brand identity will be revised for production version.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PekUrdI.png)\n\n## Final Product Specs\n\n**Case:** Injected Polycarbonate, 42 mm x 42 mm x 6 mm.\n**Movement:** Japanese.\n**Dial**: Exquisite half display reading system, black dial with contrasting numbers.\n**Glass:** Mineral glass with anti-reflective coating. \n**Strap:** Soft Silicone.\n**Water resistance:** Yes (3ATM)\n\n---\n\n# Dwiss: a decade of innovation\n\nDWISS - the manufacturer - is a niche watch brand founded in 2011 by Rafael Miranda, a former professor of watch design in Milan, Italy. His accolades include several design awards and publications in the watch industry.\n\nThe brand is committed to craft distinctive timepieces that stands out with innovative designs and groundbreaking features, including the use of pioneering materials and early adoption of web3 technology such as cryptocurrency, NFTs and metaverse experiences in the watch space.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/p8gK5Fi.png)\n\n![](https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1694722112/t9ce7v5l3t52g3azgydp.png)\n\n![](https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1694722042/xhyf0mdtyqkfiip0plmr.jpg)\n\n\n## Contemporary distribution methods\n\nDWISS also excels in modern distribution methods. Leveraging the power of crowdfunding and Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) strategies, launching multiple campaigns and mastering influencer and digital advertising. These accomplishments attest to DWISS's strong marketing and sales capabilities, setting a **solid foundation for the success of our Go-to-Market strategy for NounsWatch**.\n\nCrowdfunding campaigns that generated more than USD $1.5 million.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/U5gHT6Y.png)\n\nDwiss have a portfolio of influencers that have millions of followers especially in Youtube, but also instagram, facebook, blogs and magazines.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JS08Qcu.png)\n\nDwiss masters Digital Advertising, generating 9.4 millions of impressions, and 109k clicks in 2023 alone.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f3G84AV.png)\n\n---\n\n# A unparalleled opportunity to reach a new audience\n\nWe meticulously planned a winning Go-to-Market Strategy to make the most of it with optimal resources. **The NounsWatch collection seizes an unparalleled opportunity of introducing Nouns to a whole new audience.** \n\n## Step 0: Entering the Affordable Fashion Market\n\nIn an industry that generated over $70 billion in 2022, fashion ranks as the second most significant reason people wear watches, trailing only behind timekeeping. This largely accounts for why the fashion watch segment records the highest annual unit sales in the tens of millions. **The NounsWatch collection pricing and style aims to secure a position in the largest portion of this growing segment: the sub-$200 fashion watch market.**\n\nThat said, time to sell.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DprKVhF.png)\n\n## Step 1: A pre-sale shortcut to meet 10 Million customers on Indiegogo\n\nA common challenge to IRL products is meeting the minimum order quantities (MOQ) whilst ensuring enough demand for the product. And for custom designed watches, the MOQ of 1000 pieces makes the equation a bit challenging. \n\nThanks to Dwiss successful track record on Indiegogo campaigns we can have a reputable access to create a Drop.\n\nAn Indiegogo Drop is an exclusive offer for qualified business that serves a discount pre-sale channel without the need for the regular crowdfunding. The highlight is the added layer of marketing to reach the fullest of Indiegogo’s 10 million monthly visitors and 1 million combined social media followers from 235 countries.\n\nDwiss will launch a NounsWatch Drop pre-sale for the price of ~~$189.00~~ $129.00 with [teaser videos and images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7ZsbPHqzFw) that will feature Nouns on the homepage of the Indiegogo website, as well as in related content such as carousels, newsletters, and social media.\n\n**By doing so, we aim to generate sufficient demand for NounsWatch, particularly from outside the Nouns and watchmaking communities, thus bringing it closer to mainstream media and markets.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/exRMxAh.png)\n\n## Step 2: Continuous sale on the NounsWatch Shopify store\n\nAfter the presale window concludes, sales will resume in our website [nounswatch.com](http://nounswatch.com/) for $189.00 ($169.00 for selected communities), where we will accept both fiat currency and cryptocurrency. Leveraging the same proven digital marketing strategy that Dwiss employs for its products, we are going to use a share of the sales profit in Digital Advertising to generate millions of impressions and drive hundreds of thousands of clicks to our website, until the point of delivery and after. If demand falls short, Dwiss name is in play. We bear the risk and will undertake the responsibility of selling the product.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jIsZVSV.jpg)\n\n## Step 3: Ding-dong! Delivery Time\n\nUpon receiving the initial shipment from the factory, we'll start fulfilling orders through both Indiegogo and Shopify channels. At the same time, we'll ramp up our marketing efforts to stimulate new demand, focusing on a broad [influencer campaign and a user-generated content initiative](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5h5gh3ZqPzjm_Rrt6FKdrTbbJ00IF9Es). **This is a pivotal moment for the NounsWatch and Nouns history, and we are committed to maximizing its impact.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wztkALV.png)\n\n## Step 4: The NounsWatch Legacy\n\n**Spin the Flywheel (new!)**\nRegardless the supply, **10% of every NounsWatch collection sales revenue will be sent back to the Treasury** and submitted to Propdates. Assuming a pre-sale sold-out of 1000 pieces, the gross revenue would be $129,000. 10% of this ($12,900) goes back to the DAO treasury, further reducing the actual costs to the DAO. Sales out of the pre-sale window generate more revenue.\n\n**Release the IP (new!)**\nThe NounsWatch blueprint and 3d files **will be cc0, fully available on the public domain**.\n\n**Everyday, forever (new!)**\nThe objective for NounsWatch is not to exist as a limited edition, but rather to establish it as a standard product in the Dwiss partnership lineup. **We will sustain production for as long as consumer demand remains**, and may release new straps, models, and features when deemed appropriate.\n\n**Warranty and Customer Support**\nDwiss will provide a world-class ongoing support and warranty for customers after 2 years they have purchased NounsWatch.\n\n---\n\n## **Funds Allocation**\n\nWe have meticulously planned the budget to ensure optimal allocation of funds across all critical aspects of the project. Our financial strategy for V2 has been redesigned to sustain our competitive pricing strategy while accommodating the increased workload of the team until the sales take-off. \n\nWe have estimated the financial requirements for the NounsWatch project as follows:\n\n- $5,000 - Development\n- $90,000 - NounsWatch and straps (1,000 pieces)\n- $10,000 - Packaging\n- $25,000 - External Labor and Taxes\n- $14,000 - First-Class Video and 3D Production (third-party services)\n- $7,000 - Indiegogo Drop Paid Feature Package\n- $18,000 - Team Compensation\n\n**TOTAL ASK: $169,000 USDC**\nWallet: [dwiss.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x80b0b325D6A1E19953dFffb6Cc117263916796F8)\n\n## Timeline\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UK7lhJP.png)\n\n---\n\n## Team\n\n[Fabio Seva](https://x.com/fabioseva) - Concept & Marketing\nLilNoun#125, nouns-pilled founder of [Public Good Beer](https://twitter.com/publicgoodbeer?s=21&t=OnA_W289RIsplarDuhpSrg)\n[Rafael Miranda](https://x.com/rsmiranda) - Design\nLilNoun#7753, watch designer and Dwiss founder\n[Dwiss](https://x.com/dwisswatch) - Production and operations\n\n---\n\n**Acknowledgments:** we would like to thank the dozens of comments we received during V1, which enabled us to develop this new version. By participating in this project, the DAO is not just 'spending' on a product but making a strategic investment in invaluable brand equity. This intangible value—captured through consumer engagement, social influence, and expanded market reach—is an asset that can far outlive the investment, providing a return that is difficult to quantify. It’s important to understand that the full impact of this investment will unfold over time, requiring a level of trust in the project’s long-term vision and execution.",

DWISS team says they are confident that it will, but they are also the team submitting the prop.\n\nso the arrangement that i would support is one that the DWISS team also takes some financial risk by putting up an amount of their own capital for the production of these units (we can give back 10% revenue return suggested in the prop; we generally don't ask for revenue back to treasury for physical goods sold). then ideally the team would risk losing money on the effort if none of the units sell and would have the opt to make money if all the units sell out. in this case we would be meaningfully subsidizing the production of the units but not covering all the costs such that the producer has no risk regardless of the outcome of sales.\n\nit's totally fair if that type of risk is not what the DWISS team thinks they want to take on but this is my view after having funded a decent amount of high priced physical goods that hasn't sold. it's entirely possible that we're not ready as a brand to make these types of items since we don't have enough fans to buy these high cost branded items and non fans have little reason to be interested. thanks again for the effort around the prop.

      "description": "# Gift Nouns to three nounish pioneers: Mr. Boney, Messhup, and Sidenoun\n\n\n\n**tl:dr: Honor three early pioneers of extension projects and nounish art with Nouns: Mr. Boney, Messhup and Sidenoun.**\n\nThis prop seeks to gift three forked Nouns to three of the first artists/builders who utilized cc0 to proliferate Nouns via unique art and extensions: Mr. Boney, Messhup and Sidenoun. \n\nAs an important part of the [**virtuous cycle**,](https://medium.com/@punk4156/the-nouns-virtuous-cycle-95586bb9c7c9) the proliferation of Nouns cc0 art is key but often under recognized in its significance. These three artists in particular were very early builders in the nouns ecosystem, all were members of the first group of Nouncillors, and all have openly helped others in the ecosystem to help proliferate Nouns.\n\n**Prop Inspiration:** Important note - this idea came from me not Mr. Boney, Messhup or Sidenoun. As I was reflecting on my own nounish journey, these three kept popping up in my story, sometimes in obvious ways, other times just in the background, but always there. There are so many others who have also made strong contributions and should be recognized as well but this seemed like a great place to start.\n\nI reached out to all three and confirmed they would accept a Noun if given the opportunity and all agreed to hold it for a minimum of one year since we do not yet have a vesting contract in place. (Actually each one said they'd never sell when asked.)\n\nAs long time contributors to the ecosystem, I can think of no better future Nouners.\n\n### Mr. Boney\n\nLaunching just a couple months after Nouns on October 10, 2021, **[The Boneys](https://opensea.io/collection/theboneys)** combined Nouns and Cryptoadz to create a new spooky take on cc0 art. The collection has some well known holders, among them [**David Horvath**](https://x.com/davidzhorvath/status/1448014564159799307?s=20) (a Boney whale) and Luca Netz. \n\nIn addition to The Boneys, Mr. Boney also created [**The Boney Bats**](https://opensea.io/collection/the-boney-batz), [**UniToadz**](https://opensea.io/collection/unitoadz), [**$PepeToadz**](https://opensea.io/collection/pepetoadz) and has contributed advice and assistance on numerous other projects including the [**Yellow Collective**](https://x.com/theboneys/status/1711251203093626976?s=20).\n\n \nThe Boneys continues to captivate and provide a unique character in the Nouniverse, recognized all on its own as well as part of the Nouns ecosystem, even finding its way to the NFT mural in NYC, the first piece of nounish art to do so.\n \n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyjYkq4Gp.png)\n\n\n\n---\n\n### Messhup\n\nAt the core of almost every iconic piece of nounish art is Messhup, including pieces such as the **[Meta Noun Square](https://opensea.io/collection/the-meta-square-a-special-open-edition-by-messhup)**, the [**Rose Parade open edition**,](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x628d8222f064e3a29a69814bd13974b0160e8538) and **[the Nouniversary](https://opensea.io/collection/nounniversary-01)**, and the incredible nounish sails for NFT.NYC. Whenever a banger art piece is needed, Messhup is tapped and always over-delivers.\n\nBeyond these amazing individual pieces of nounish art, [**Messhup**](https://opensea.io/Messhup/created) has launched multiple cc0 collections of his own including PeeperToadz, [**Meme Seizer**](https://opensea.io/collection/meme-seizer), and [**Serial Collectors**](https://opensea.io/collection/serialcollectors).\n  \nAlso an original member of Nouncil, Messhup created the **[Nouncil logo](https://nouncil.wtf/)** and supports nounish builders with his art, even recently dropping a piece out of the blue to honor the **[Boneversary](https://x.com/messhup/status/1712625204684333166?s=20)**.\n\n ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1cZNqNfp.png)\n\n \n\n---\n\n### Sidenoun\n\nOne of the first recipients of a small grant from Nouns, Sidenoun launched the **[SideNoun](https://opensea.io/collection/sdn)** NFT project at the end of 2021 – an art project of cute nouns with their shifty eyes and the tagline: isometric nouns, looking highly suspicious. **[I personally came in through the SideNoun door](https://https://paragraph.xyz/@nounishprof/sidenoun)**, where I first encountered David Horvath in the discord and he set me straight on nouns traits. Not without its bumps and learnings, the Sidenoun project continues to shine as a small grants success story. \n\nBeyond this project, Sidenoun was also part of the original Nouncil core team – **[Nouncillor #1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gxXEoxUhHbcRZVSIB3mVbmRp3lfv-clnevIMuqiY2Jo/edit#gid=0)**! -- and went on to develop **[BYN: Build Your Noun](https://byn.wtf/)**. In the early days, you could find him lending a helping hand in the Nouns discord. He also has been a contributor/advisor to many other nounish projects, including providing guidance, assistance and technical development for FloriNouns and Vessel Verse among others.\n\nSidenoun was also one of the projects highlighted by Bud Light leading up to the Nouns appearance in their Super Bowl commercial.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1-2H5VfT.png)\n\n\n\n---\n\nAlthough there are many such deserving nounsfolk, I believe these three  -- **[Mr. Boney](https://twitter.com/theboneys)**, **[Messhup](https://twitter.com/messhup)**, and **[Sidenoun](https://twitter.com/sidenoun)** -- capture the essence of cc0 proliferation and have helped attract many to the Nouns ecosystem through their original artistic efforts.\n\n\n---\n\n \n**Summary of transactions:**\n\nNoun 326 to MrBoney.eth: 0x22D8D269A083EAD12E8D7F8fb9AdD8A38B5F4134 \n\nNoun 81 to Messhup.eth: 0x0C66d954d9cb1ebDF4E37a000262323C83655e70 \n\nNoun 826 to Sidenoun.eth  0xdB7f66F3D53A6A0EC43a49C7B6713e1bd3bd1383",

It seamlessly combines nounishness and horology, **on the verge of becoming the most personal product Nouns has ever created**.\n\n`⌐◨-◨ for the wrists`\n\n---\n\n## Positioning\nThe watch industry is a lucrative market, with the segment accounting for over US$70 billion in revenue in 2022. We aim to position NounsWatch within the most attractive range of world-class watch brands: the affordable design (<200 USD).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DprKVhF.png)\n\n\n---\n## The NounsWatch design\nDesigned by renowned watch designer Rafael Miranda, the bold Noggle-inspired design features a superb polycarbonate case, a Japanese movement, and a exquisite half display with a glass mirror and a black dial.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PleFEx9.png)\nThe strap is made of easy interchangeable silicone rubber in either one color or the available Nouns Accessory themes (TBD).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9ptDzga.png)\nThe hour and minute handles features individual pieces that combines every hour to form the Noggles symbol.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mEBtHNJ.gif)\n\nNot only have we considered its aesthetic appeal, focusing on style and taste, but we've also paid meticulous attention to its function. It's as much about refinement as it is about precision.\n\n---\n## Specs\n\n**Case:** Polycarbonate, 42 mm x 42 mm x 6 mm. Fits from wrists of 15cm and up\n**Movement:** Japanese\n**Dial**: Exquisite half display reading system, black dial with contrasting numbers\n**Glass:** Mineral glass with anti-reflective coating \n**Strap:** Easy interchangeable silicone rubber in various colors and patterns\n\n---\n## First Prototypes\nIn order to show our commitment to the project, we have developed two 3d printed prototypes as you can see below. Imagine how amazing they will look with the final production finish and the colored straps!\n\nVideo: [here](https://x.com/rsmiranda/status/1714557390241059120?s=20) and [here](https://x.com/fabioseva/status/1714901327631843711?s=46&t=OnA_W289RIsplarDuhpSrg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Fm1vcc4.png)\n\n---\n\n## Timeline\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ugqJkvg.png)\n\n\n**Phase 1: Prototype (done √)**\n\n**Phase 2 (option1): NFT Airdrop (~2 weeks)**\nAs soon as the prop get funded, we are going to take a snapshot and airdrop 888 Nounswatch NFTs to Nouns holders (incl. Treasury Nouns). Each Nounswatch NFT is eligible to redeem 1 (one) physical Nounswatch on [https://nounswatch.com](https://nounswatch.com/) (beta), thus no need to connect and verify Nouns tokens.\n\n**Phase 2: Color and straps variants definition (~2 weeks)**\n- watch crown side\n- 8 solid color variants (body + strap)\n- 8 strap patterns that will be produced.\n\n**Phase 3: Claim window (~4 weeks)**\nOur Shopify storefront is gonna showcase the product, including all watch colors and strap variants available and handle the redeem information. By connecting wallet with web3 connect, token holders are eligible a FREE watch + two straps of choice + shipping. The claiming window is needed to guarantee quantities for each body/strap colors. After the window, we no longer guarantee the colors, and the redemption will be first come first serve.\n\n**Phase 4: Production (~8 weeks)**\nWe are going to share images and content of the entire production process (moulding, injection, painting etc).\n\n**Phase 5: Assembling, Packaging & Shipping  (~2 weeks)**\nAfter receiving the final product from the factory we initiate the assembling, packaging, handling and shipping of Nounswatch to users.\n\n**Phase 6: warranty and after sales service for 2 years**\nDwiss will provide a world-class ongoing support and warranty for customers after 2 years they have claimed/purchased Nounswatch. This also includes long-term storage (>2y) of unclaimed watches.\n\n**Promotional Video / Ad**\nOnce the first pieces are delivered we are going to create showcase video of Nounswatch and the Nouns Brand for marketing purposes.\n\n\n\n---\n## Team\n**Fabio Seva** ([https://x.com/fabioseva](https://x.com/fabioseva?s=21&t=OnA_W289RIsplarDuhpSrg)) **- Concept & Marketing**\nLilNoun#125, nouns-pilled founder of [Public Good Beer](https://twitter.com/publicgoodbeer?s=21&t=OnA_W289RIsplarDuhpSrg)\n\n**Rafael Miranda** ([https://x.com/rsmiranda](https://x.com/rsmiranda?s=21&t=TBiiMRlpGleVhBPiCCngDQ)) **- Design**\nAn experienced watch designer with hundreds of watch collections designed for brands and personalities (incl.

I like the quirky design, fabio has executed well with public good beer, and rafael seems like an expert. there's a lot to like.\n\nhowever, critically, a way in which I think this prop misses is that it assumes selling 888 units to the dao is success. we have maybe 100 nouners. more than half of the supply is in the treasury and a lot of tokens in circulation are held by ppl with more than one token. so we're giving max 100 ppl these (maybe a few dozen will actually end up claiming and wearing it?) and the rest will just sit in our treasury. we could give them out but that in itself is a project and hard to judge its value.\n\nin general, I'm not really excited about distribution plans that are essentially \"we'll make physical goods and sell the supply to the dao to give to token holders or distribute.\" if we think there's something really fun or exceptional we're willing to subsidize the production and distribution of the product but I would much prefer a plan where there is an end customer that is buying the product rather than selling the supply back to the dao. the producer should have conviction that the supply could be sold and should be taking some risk as well imo. \n\nthank you for the detailed prop!",

Check out our playable demo here (use Safari for MacOS users):\n[NounsTown Demo](https://thepixelshop.itch.io/nounstown-demo)\n\n\n# PROLIFERATION\nOur proposal aims to proliferate Nouns by focusing on a ***specific target market of the PC gaming community*** that is interested in indie games, specifically ***the rogue-lite genre***.  A rogue-lite indie game provides a compelling opportunity for Nouns to enter the gaming sector due to the following reasons:\n\n##### Rising Popularity\n- Indie developers have had incredible success in recent years due to their ability to design ***innovating*** and ***creative*** new games that AAA studios often avoid\n- Developers have gained access to multiple ***mass distribution platforms*** such as Steam, Nintendo Switch, Itch.io, and Epic Games to reach a wide audience\n- Available resources and advancements in game development have provided a landscape for small teams, or even individual developers, to produce games with a ***powerful cultural impact and longevity***\n\n##### Lower Risk Entry to Gaming\n- We conceptualized the game design to ensure as much value and ***replay-ability*** while maintaining a ***reasonable scope*** of work and ***longer-term scalability***\n- Our proposal provides for a ***phased funding and development approach*** to ensure a ***transparent production*** process, opportunities to receive ***community feedback***, and provide multiple ***tiers of content***\n- We will use ***Steam as our distribution platform*** to launch the game; however, we will explore porting the game to Nintendo Switch after the initial launch and financial considerations\n\n##### The Charm of Pixel Art\n- Our art team collectively has over ***30 years of pixel art experience*** and will design a game aesthetic that will resonate with indie gamers and pixel art enthusiasts\n- Pixel art games have had tremendous success with nearly ***13,000 games available on Steam.***  Some household names including Stardew Valley, Shovel Knight, Celeste, Terraria, Hyper Light Drifter, Enter the Gungeon, Octopath Traveler, and Baba is You\n- Our game will showcase many different pixel art styles including our ***modern aesthetic gameplay, retro style UI and game map, and high resolution portraits***\n\n##### Creative Commons\n- All of the ***art and animations*** that we produce during development will be ***open-source*** and available to the community to use!\n- ***After development***, we will ***consider making the game open-source*** to collaborate with game developers and artists to contribute new content\n\n# GAME OVERVIEW\n##### Game Engine\nThe game will be developed using ***Godot 4***, a free and open-source game development engine!  \n\n##### Genre\n**Rogue-Lite**\nThe key feature of a Rogue-Lite genre is a game loop that results in ***permadeath***.  Each time a player begins their attempt or run, they will either defeat the final boss or die trying.  A Rogue-Lite game generally involves some ***permanent progression*** that takes place ***outside of the run***; usually in the form of upgraded weapons, statistics, abilities, or skill trees.\n\n**Bullet Hell**\nBullet Hell combat mechanics emphasize ***complex bullet patterns*** for the player to navigate and dodge.  Our bullet hell game will be designed as a twin stick shooter where the player is on a ***flat plane with a top-down perspective***.  They will then use one joystick to control the player and the other joystick to control the direction of shooting, or for the real ones, mouse for shooting and keyboard for movement!\n\n**Non-Linear Progression**\nOne of the unique selling points of our Rogue-Lite game is that it will have Non-Linear progression.  The two main features to highlight in this design include a ***unique map that is generated each run*** and the freedom for the player to ***decide their order of progression***.    Each location will have distinct characteristics that the Player may take advantage of depending on their weapon selection and upgrade composition.  \n\n**Inspiration**\n[Enter the Gungeon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/311690/Enter_the_Gungeon/), [Hades](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/), [Risk of Rain 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/632360/Risk_of_Rain_2/), [Nuclear Throne](https://store.steampowered.com/app/242680/Nuclear_Throne/), [Vampire Survivors](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/)\n\n\n##### Story\nWelcome to the world of ***Nouns Town***, a charming community nestled amidst pixelesque landscapes.  The citizens of **********Nouns Town********** are visionaries that seek to build a spectacular new world as seen through a new type of lens, ***Noggles**!*  These Noggles may look like quirky little glasses, but they empower the wearer to harness the boundless energy within themselves.\n\nBut an ominous cloud is forming over Nouns Town.  The malignant ***Lich King*** has arrived with an ***army of shadowy minions*** to seize these *Noggles* and exploit their power to build their own evil empire.  Nouns Town desperately needs a hero to put an end to the invasion!\n\n##### Primary Game Mode: One Noun, Every Day, Forever\n- Play as a new Nouns character every rolling 24-hour period beginning with Noun #1 and all Nouns that follow\n- Every player will attempt the daily run with the same weapon, world map, upgrade choices, and enemy spawns\n- The map seed will change each day along with the playable character\n- Compete against all other players on the leaderboard for the fastest clear time\n- All daily winners will secure their place in the game’s history!\n\n![A Noun A Day Promo](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2Febdf3ba8-dbc9-460f-8931-857889572ea5%2Fstage_nouns_v_souls.png?table=block&id=cbaa22ac-9c9d-4d42-856c-64c595492dde&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Traditional Game Mode: Protonoun\n**Play as the Protonoun in a traditional rogue-lite game mode**\n- Select your starting weapon and begin your run in a unique generative map\n- Gain Upgrades as you progress through each room of enemies\n- Search for two hidden keys to unlock each stage Boss\n- Encounter NPCs and Events as you explore the map\n- Complete achievements during your run to unlock new content\n- Defeat the final boss, the Lich King, to beat the game\n\n![The Protocave](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2F91f59fde-3358-41dc-8a8a-14f1721c4141%2Fprotocave.png?table=block&id=dd19d7a6-e01a-4bd6-86b1-838af593bf3d&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Weapons\n\nThe player will begin each run by selecting a single weapon type.  As they progress through the game, their weapon gets upgraded to powerful new tiers.  New weapons are unlocked through an achievements system and provide diverse play styles and synergies, for example:\n\n- Sniper Rifles - Slow fire rate and reload rate, but high single target damage\n- Shotguns - high close range damage, but wide bullet spread at long range\n- Rocket and Grenade Launchers - significant area of effect damage, but slow reload speed and fire rate\n- Assault rifles - higher ammo capacity and fire rate, but less damage per bullet\n\n**Sample** **Weapons:**\n![Weapon Concepts](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2F457fa7a0-a1a4-4ec4-ad5d-b0887aa853cb%2Fweapons.png?table=block&id=f4229042-9adf-4a99-9c0c-83b4fcdde425&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Upgrades\nAs the player clears each room,  they are rewarded a pair of Noggles to return to their rightful owner and gain a new weapon modifier.  Each upgrade is inspired by various characters from the Nouns collection.  Early concepts include:\n\n- Lightning Bolt Noun unlocks chain lightning\n- Basketball Noun unlocks bouncing bullets\n- Popsicle Noun unlocks frost bullets\n- Pencil Noun unlocks piercing bullets\n- Chipboard Noun unlocks spark aura\n- Baseball Noun unlocks curving bullets\n\nPlayer upgrades each have multiple tiers of strength.  Further, different combinations of upgrades will create fun synergies and provide a unique gameplay experience each run.  Unique and innovative upgrades will be explored during game development.\n\n![Upgrade Card Previews](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2Feef9abba-1288-4e3d-9be3-02216f525651%2Fnouns_upgrades_promo.png?table=block&id=d9a79c15-bee4-42f8-ae7e-5b1a53e0d826&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Minions and Bosses\n\nMinions and Bosses will be based on the Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult: Forgotten Souls collection.  All minions will be designed to have a diverse range of attack styles and bullet patterns.  Early attack style concepts include melee, burst range, sniper range, summoners, and complex bullet patterns for elite minions.  \n\nWe will use rare NFTs from the Forgotten Souls collection as our Stage Bosses and the Lich King as our final boss.  Our first Boss engagement will be designed and implemented in Phase I of production.\n\n**Sample** **Minion Designs:**\n![Minion Concepts](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2Fed2d7a9a-3f76-484b-9c3b-a8bef7f00f4a%2Fminions.png?table=block&id=c90faec9-9a19-40dc-9b9a-aeab46b202ab&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Map and Room Design\n\nWith the game’s setting taking place in Nouns Town, our protagonist will progress through the map to clear each location of the Forgotten Souls.  As mentioned in the Genre section above, our map and game loop will have a ***Non-Linear*** design.  The design will have the following characteristics:\n\n**Unique Generative Maps**\n\n- Each run will generate a new Nouns Town map seed with approximately 30 - 45 Locations, 2 Stage Boss chambers, and 1 Final Boss chamber\n- The Player will have the freedom to decide which locations to clear first\n\n**NPC and Event Rooms**\n\n- We will include friendly NPCs and locations to provide healing, potential upgrades, and/or narrative progression\n- Additionally, we are exploring various Event Rooms that occur random times throughout each run that provide new challenges for the player\n\n**Room Architecture**\n\n- We will design a large library of Locations and Rooms that the map generator will pull from to maintain a unique and diverse world for each play through\n- Room types within each location will have consistent thematic designs to provide new challenges and allow the player to associate location aesthetics to gameplay characteristics\n\n**Room Decorations**\n\n- We will produce a library of tile sets, decorations, barriers, and destructible objects to fill each room with a fun and unique personality inspired by Nouns\n- We will mix and match each room’s architecture to various aesthetics to give each room a unique personality and provide diversity between each run\n\n**Sample assets:**\n![Tile Set Preview](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263%2F440c398d-3d22-4e10-93c7-1ed447b2e1ca%2Ftileset_sample.png?table=block&id=7419a6e2-cfd2-4208-9a47-5d3715964af5&spaceId=5fdb596a-f044-4277-a067-1d0c0adeb263&width=2000&userId=b2ba77e2-e1fb-4bba-a5e3-92cbd6539673&cache=v2)\n\n##### Sound Design\n\nFull sound design will include sound effects and an original soundtrack.  We aim to capture a combination of playful comic-like sound effects paired with a sound track inspired by hip-hop and funk instrumentals.  We are in discussion with a number of experienced sound designers that are interested in joining the team later in development.\n\n# PRODUCTION STATUS\n\n##### Pre-Production Complete - Phase 0: Design, Prototype, and Art Style\n\nOur team began production in July 2023 and have established the game design document, art and animation style, game framework and systems, and our initial prototype.

Being able to evaluate game proposals in context (i.e. Out of a wide range of Nouns games, which ones should we fund?) is much more productive than trying to evaluate each game in isolation. Let's start games in Prop House as much as possible, so that we have a range of reference points.

          "reason": "Since i signaled For ive had the chance give this prop more thought and also talk in person with Sumiez.\n\nAfter speaking with Sumiez im even more excited for him and his studio to take on Nouns and build an amazing indie game on top of the already rich nouns world and lore.\n\nBut i had to stop myself from projecting what i want this game to be, vs whats actually written in the proposal, and decided to vote Against in hopes of Sumiez coming back with an improved version.\n\nNow to some (hopefully) actionable feedback:\n- This proposal spends a lot of time pitching the genre (and its merits) rather than actually going deep on why _this_ game will be amazing. I wish it instead spent more time selling me on the game mechanics and going deep on how those mechanics can mesh with the current nouns lore and culture. The current prop does go into some detail wrt mechanics but its reads too much like a checklist ('there will be NPCs') and doesnt provide enough justification or paint a compelling picture as to why this makes the game better, or how it all fits together as a singular, focused gaming experience.\n- The art direction is a mixed bag. The pixel art definitely looks good, but the enemies, guns, etc looks out of place and its clear its not made for nouns. Even if those are placeholder assets(?) i believe the prop would gain from thinking more deeply about what weapons and enemies/antagonists (why a lich king?) makes sense in the context of nouns and explain that in words instead of pictures. (Merging the world with Forgotten Runes does not make much sense to me.)\n- I only want to vote for this prop if it has a *chance* of being another indie cult classic like some of the games references as inspiration. Speaking with Sumiez i get the sense thats what he wants to do *too*, but i dont think the prop does a good enough job communicating that ambition.\n- I would like Sumiez to spend more time in Nouns to better and more deeply understand nouns before drawing up the general game mechanics. I think this might be key to create something that is amazing vs simply competent delivery. (Supriyo comes to mind as a media creator who does this very well.)\n- Game dev is hard and takes an awful lot of time. Understanding how tough it is to present a 'vertical slice' to the dao, i urge the team to instead get the cultural touch points of nouns, coupled with a small handful of example assets and key mechanics, _just right_ as that will instill a lot of confidence and help provide you the initial funding/runway to go deeper/bigger.",

However, I am not convinced that the gameplay presented here, and the team, are the right choices.\n\nHere are detailed reasons why I vote against:\n\n1) The gameplay is simple and lacks uniqueness. Run and gun games are over-saturated market and have limited story depth.\n2) It appears that The Pixel Shop already has several ongoing projects, which, in my opinion, would prevent you from dedicating full time to the nouns-inspired game.\n3) I believe the DAO will be able to fund only one or two $600k games. Before committing to such funding, it would be wiser to commission 10 indie games with budgets of $10-20K each to explore different gameplays and development teams. It would be best to start an initiative that resembles the Nouns Stories (prop180), where the DAO commissions a series of cost-effective experiments and then would select one idea, that fits best the nouns, for future funding.",

          "reason": "My context is that I fucking LOVE playing video games, especially retro video games, and would love to see the DAO fund an indie game. \n\nI have some thoughts and feedback on the proposal and strongly encourage the team to return with a new proposal.\n\nFeedback w/beat-em-up as the format:\n\n1) I would prefer if the team considered how to incorporate **Noggles are a core part of the game mechanic**, since Noggles are the simplest distillation of what is Nounish that we can possibly have.\n\n2) If the team would like to pursue a beat em up format: How do we make Noggles feel as special as they are to our community? Consider how Hollow Knight has charms that offer different power ups — could different Noggles offer unique powers when equipped? And could your quest be to collect all the Noggles? Other potential ideas: strawberries in Celeste, frogs in Mother 3, question blocks in Mario...\n\n3) In terms of aesthetic and vibes, I'm gently encouraging the team to explore a more vibrant, optimistic palette. Nouns is a whimsical brand with strong, happy colors; thus the screenshots in this prop look off-world to me. But this is not super strong feedback FYI :) \n\n4) The demo doesn't load for me on itch.\n\nFeedback on game format:\n\n1) The helpful constraint that beat-em-ups offer is that you can focus on basic fighting and movement mechanics, and focus more on great art and level design. It's helpful that you don't need a good story, so I can understand why this format is a good constraint.\n\n2) However, Nouns is so WEIRD and whimsical that I am craving something super weird when it comes to games. I wonder if there's a way to make a fun game without blowing up scope — focusing on 1-3 super awesome-to-play mechanics like Towerfall / Celeste / Hollow Knight / Hyper Light Drifter / Kirby — or super fun in-game laws like Baba Is You or Katamari Damacy.\n\n3) If the team does consider changing formats, I encourage them to return with a proposal to fund a super scoped proof of concept on the game mechanic in action.",

      "description": "# Sensuality in Art: Proposal for Funding a Transformative Project\n\nThe tone of the project will be one of inclusivity, respect, and open-mindedness. Our objective is to establish a new branch within the DAO, a more mature and secure space where artists can freely express their interpretations of nounish in art space. Simultaneously, we encourage the DAO to approach this topic with an open heart and mind. By promoting dialogue and understanding, we aim to challenge preconceived notions and nurture a more mature, accepting, and diverse community.\n\n\n\n**Note:** The project's creators have chosen to maintain their anonymity, prioritizing a focus on the project's message and artistic vision rather than individual recognition. \n\n\n\n# First Shot : Sensuality\n\n**Introduction:** In the world of art, sensuality has always played a vital role in evoking emotions, pushing societal boundaries, and expanding creative horizons. This proposal aims to investigate the profound connection between sensuality and art, while seeking funding for a project that celebrates and explores sensuality in various forms. By delving into this captivating topic, we aspire to craft a thought-provoking experience that visually engages and inspires the community. \nKeywords: Sensuality, art, community.\n\n**Body:**\n\nThe proposed project aims to create seven immersive art pieces, each representing different expressions of sensuality applied to characteristic nouns, corresponding to the seven days of the week. By collaborating with four esteemed photography artists, our goal is to craft a visual experience that celebrates sensuality and its richness.\n\nThese pieces will be thoughtfully curated to explore various facets of sensuality, including its ties to human emotions and the natural world. Through meticulously designed works of art, we aim to prompt viewers to contemplate their own perceptions of sensuality and challenge societal norms surrounding this often-misunderstood concept.\n\nTo ensure the success of this project, we are seeking funding to cover several aspects, including artist fees, additional incentives, production, and the care of these pieces. By securing the necessary funds, we can provide artists and staff with the resources they require to create impactful and thought-provoking artworks.\n\nFurthermore, this project aspires to extend beyond its initial phase. Future plans include organizing more immersive and expressive materials, enabling viewers to engage visually and musically.\n\n\n\n**Rise of Sensuality:**\n\nSensuality, often considered taboo in many cultures, holds delicate curves and unique identity within the body. Art, in its purest form, serves as a means of self-expression for the body, a visual language.\n\nAllow me to introduce one of the guest artists - [Guido](https://x.com/guidodisalle), a renowned name in photography, known for his aesthetic sensibilities and indescribable visual prowess.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/k4RMWal.jpeg)\n\n[Guido Di Salle's](https://www.flowcode.com/page/guido)\n\n**Minting and Distribution**\n\nOut of the seven pieces produced, only two will be made available for minting as limited editions, created by our invited artists. Details will be provided on each guest artist's profile when unveiling their piece.\n\n**Cost:** 7E to cover team expenses, provide additional incentives, and compensate the artists + 4 NounsVision to be sent to invited artists.\n\n**Conclusion:** In conclusion, this project seeks to explore the captivating intersection of sensuality and art through an immersive experience that can enrich our cultural understanding and initiate a new community. With secured funding, we can embark on a journey with talented artists to create a transformative experience, challenging societal norms and celebrating diverse expressions of nounish in the world of art.",

The beauty of CC0 is that you can execute first and receive approval later. Instead of funding upfront as an official branch within the DAO - a designation that I’m uncomfortable with for any proposal - launching a derivative and then seeking retro funding for approval seems like the way to go.\n\nWould love to see the team go ahead and execute this as a derivative, regardless of the proposal outcome. That would help build support in the Nouns community and not require an “official” designation upfront before anyone sees the approach.\n\n*sent from voter.wtf*",

      "description": "# 1 ETH Test: Stacking Treasury Yield With Origin Ether\n\n![OETH Graphic](https://imageupload.io/ib/7wHXLUdXjhsKHYD_1695230412.png)\n\n**TL;DR**: \n\nI am Peter from the Origin Protocol core team. This is a proposal for a (very) low-risk test to earn yield for the Nouns treasury by utilizing Origin Ether ([OETH](https://oeth.com/)). Converting 1 ETH into 1 OETH (they are 1:1) for 30 days would act as a case study to test that Nouns can safely earn high risk-adjusted yields for the treasury by utilizing OETH. \n\nOrigin Protocol is an OG team that launched in 2017. We launched OETH about 4 months ago, with the goal of making it possible for retail users to earn the same kind of yields that institutional traders earn, without needing millions of dollars and a full-fledged trading team. OETH deploys collateral to blue-chip protocols, distributing the yield back to holders daily via positive rebase. Current OETH yield is 8.01% APY on ETH, or about 2x that of the largest LSTs. \n\nWe have seen much larger test case props to Nouns ([Prop 320 for example](https://nouns.wtf/vote/320)); in our opinion this is much too large of an amount to test a new technology with, which is why we are proposing to begin with a 1 OETH test, and can submit an additional proposal in the future for an increased amount as the Nouns community becomes more familiar with OETH. \n\nThis proposal will include two transactions: the first to convert 1 ETH into 1 OETH, and the second to opt the Nouns wallet in for yield generation.\n\nA more detailed overview on the proposal and on how OETH works can be found below. \n\n![OETH Graphic](https://imageupload.io/ib/3Uu8NmrrBr6axiU_1695230390.png)\n\n## Stacking Treasury Yield With OETH\n\nPrevious Relevant Proposals:\n18 - [Stake 1 eth in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/18)\n22 - [Stake 10% of treasury in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/22)\n30 - [Stake additional 10% of treasury in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/30)\n52 - [Increase Treasury stETH Position to ~20%](https://nouns.wtf/vote/52)\n217 - [Stake additional 5000 ETH in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/217)\n227 - [Stake additional 5000 ETH in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/227)\n313 - [stETH peg protection](https://nouns.wtf/vote/313)\n320 - [Treasury Diversification](https://nouns.wtf/vote/320)\n\n**Summary**: \n\nThis is a proposal to convert 1 ETH into 1 Origin Ether ([OETH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/origin-ether)) to test OETH yield generation for the Nouns treasury.\n\n**Abstract**:\n\nThis is a low-risk test to increase the yield of the Nouns treasury ETH/stETH from 0-4% to 8-10% utilizing Origin Ether (OETH). Converting 1 ETH into 1 OETH for 30 days would form a similar hypothesis as proposal 18 - in this case, that Nouns can safely stack yields utilizing OETH. \n\n**Motivation**:\n\nFrom proposals 18, 22, 30, 52, 217, and 227, it is clear that the Nouns DAO was interested in earning yield on the treasury and extending the project runway. Proposal 313 signals that the community would prefer to continue earning yield with stETH, instead of eliminating risk completely and converting entirely back to ETH. Proposal 320 signals that other mainnet LSTs can be useful for treasury diversification. \n\nThe OETH TVL has been trending upwards at a rate of about $1m per day since launch and has been crushing it in comparison to direct competitors with the yield we are generating. OETH yield is currently at 8.01% APY, whereas icETH APY is down to 2.94% and Cian stETH strategy is down to 4.02% despite taking leverage.\n\nWe are proposing to begin with 1 OETH, and can submit an additional proposal in the future to increase the amount as the community becomes more familiar with OETH. OETH provides significantly increased yields while also protecting against centralization and slashing events. \n\n\n## OETH Overview\n\nOrigin Ether was launched in May 2023 and is an ERC20 LST aggregator that generates blue chip yield while sitting in your wallet. OETH is backed 1:1 by stETH, rETH, frxETH, ETH, and WETH at all times; holders can go in and out of OETH as they please. Similar to stETH, OETH yield is paid out daily and automatically (sometimes multiple times per day) through a positive rebase in the form of additional OETH, proportional to the amount of OETH held.\n\nOETH yield, currently ~8.00% APY, comes from a combination of:\n\n1. Deploying ETH/WETH on Curve, Convex, and Morpho\n2. LST validator rewards\n3. A 50bip exit fee is charged to those who choose to exit OETH via the [dapp](https://app.oeth.com/) (completely avoidable if using a DEX), this fee goes back to OETH holders\n4. OETH sitting in non-upgradable smart contracts does not rebase, instead the interest generated from those tokens is provided to those that can rebase\n\nThese 4 yield generating functions combined enable OETH to generate higher yields than holding or farming any single LST manually. The current collateral allocation and yield strategies can be seen on-chain at all times via the [OETH analytics page](https://www.oeth.com/analytics). Future OETH collateral and yield strategies are governed by [OGV stakers](https://governance.ousd.com/stake).\n\nObtaining OETH is seamless, anyone can convert from ETH, stETH, rETH, or frxETH into OETH via any of the following methods:\n\n- Minting on [OETH.com](https://app.oeth.com/)\n- Swapping on [Curve](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-298/deposit)\n- Swapping on [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x856c4efb76c1d1ae02e20ceb03a2a6a08b0b8dc3&outputCurrency=ETH)\n- Swapping on [Maverick](https://app.mav.xyz/pool?chain=1&tokenA=0x856c4efb76c1d1ae02e20ceb03a2a6a08b0b8dc3&tokenB=0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2&fee=0.0004&width=0.001) \n- Swapping on [Sushiswap](https://app.sushi.com/swap?inputCurrency=ETH&outputCurrency=0x856c4Efb76C1D1AE02e20CEB03A2A6a08b0b8dC3&chainId=1)\n\nFor this proposal, Nouns will be using [The Zapper](https://docs.oeth.com/core-concepts/the-zapper) to convert the 1 ETH into 1 OETH. A second transaction will also be included to ensure the Nouns wallet is [opted-in for yield generation](https://docs.oeth.com/core-concepts/elastic-supply/rebasing-and-smart-contracts). \n\n**Benefits of Using OETH**\n\nThere are a few reasons for why Nouns would choose to use OETH over of attempting to use the same yield strategies: \n\n- The yield will always be higher with OETH than if you were to use any of the same yield strategies, since not all OETH is opted-in for yield, and because of the exit fee. At the moment 23,731 OETH is collecting yield and 21,280 is not, so Nouns would receive this boost in yield from the OETH opted-out. With the exit fee Nouns would get paid each time there's an exit - occasionally this puts the combined yield into the 100s!\n\n- The Curve/Convex strategy would be very difficult (if not impossible) to replicate without having a Curve pool with a gauge + millions in TVL - Nouns would essentially need its own token and voting power and would be competing for yield with the other large flywheel token holders. \n\n- If Nouns were to do the same strategies, someone would need to manage the position. The OETH protocol would be that manager, with collateral reallocated among the whitelisted yield strategies each week. \n\n- The OETH protocol chases not just the highest yields but also the safest. During the weekend of March 10 when USDC and DAI depegged, it took the OUSD strategists/Origin engineers about 4 minutes to notice the depeg, and 16 minutes to start the process of moving the funds to a safer strategy. $0 were lost! \n\n- The OETH protocol covers all gas costs for moving funds between yield strategies, which is happening weekly but eventually will happen daily. With the price of gas on Ethereum, this could get costly for Nouns if Nouns were to follow the same reallocation schedule. \n\n- The cost for security - Origin has OpenZeppelin on retainer! Every new OETH contract is audited before going live. OETH security is prioritized over new feature development. The same level of security would cost Nouns millions of dollars in audit and development costs. \n\n- Top-notch development team - OETH shares 95% of the same code as OUSD, which has been live on mainnet for more than 3 years - longer than the Nouns DAO! The battle-tested code that has seen almost $400m combined has been and continues to be developed by a team of 10 full-time engineers. This level of talent required to maintain the smart contracts would be extremely expensive for Nouns, if Nouns were to try and replicate the OETH strategies. \n\n\n## Usage of Funds Generated\n\nSince launch, OETH has earned a yield of about 2x that of stETH yield. With the extra yield generated for the Nouns treasury, there are several avenues for using the additional funds:\n\n- Subsidizing public goods spend - Nouns traditionally spends ~800 ETH per month on public goods\n- Subsidizing Nouns marketing - this would offset the cost for future Nouns movies, paid promotions, conference expenses, swag, and Noggles \n- Subsidizing Nouns infrastructure and auction expenses \n- Subsidizing cost for collaboration with other projects - Pudgy Penguins is just the beginning! \n- Funding large team efforts for less - it would take 50% of the stETH yield to fund another Nounish or Agora sized team effort\n- Extended DAO runway - Nouns would extend the project runway twice as long\n\n\n**Community Cases for Increased Yield**\n\nI also don't think getting to our eth position to 100% staked eth limits our spending in any way… the ~500 ETH additional yield we'll get from staking the 10k ETH is not nothing. It's being able to fund another ~$1M / year sized team. That's like being able to fund another nounish or agora sized team effort, which is meaningful! - *Noun40*\n\nI think the DAO should maintain around ~6mo of operating spend as ETH… diversify into other staking providers to reduce concentration risk. Overall in agreement with staking more ETH to increase runway. - *cfeng.eth*\n\nThe income generated from holding stETH also amounts to ~500 ETH / yr, which is more than 2 weeks of auctions. - *noun12.eth*\n\nstETH is a better way of holding eth - *fugazi.eth*\n\nI believe there is already too much of the treasury being staked in Lido. I am not interested in staking more, and if I were, I would want to use some other protocol that isn't Lido since we already have a lot in Lido. - *onnnnnnnion.eth*\n\n\n\n## Potential Risks and Mitigation\n\nThere are six possible risks when using OETH, and Origin is making sure to reduce each risk as much as possible:\n\n*New token risk* - Given OETH is a relatively new token, some may be worried that OETH is prone to new attack surfaces. While this may be true for other new tokens, OETH was built reusing 95% of the OUSD code, of which 10+ audits have been done since 2020. Not that long ago, [OUSD reached a market cap of $300m](https://defillama.com/protocol/origin-dollar) without breaking, and without diminishing the APY it was capable of generating. Origin continues to work on OUSD, despite the lower market cap.\n\n*Counterparty risk* - OETH is governed by OGV stakeholders around the world. Everything from yield generation to fee collection and distribution is managed by a set of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. These contracts are upgradeable with a timelock and are controlled by hundreds of governance token holders. While the initial contracts and yield-earning strategies were developed by the Origin team, anyone can shape the future of OETH by creating or voting on proposals, submitting new strategies, or contributing code improvements. We intend for all important decisions to be made through community governance and limited powers to be delegated to trusted contributors who are more actively involved in the day-to-day management of the protocol.\n\n*Smart contract risk of the yield strategies* - Origin is only using platforms for yield generation that have a proven track record, have been audited, have billions in TVL, maintain a bug bounty program, and provide over-collateralized loans. Over-collateralization in itself, combined with liquidations, provides a reasonable level of security for lenders.\n\n*Collateral risk* - Origin has chosen 3 of the largest LSTs to ever exist to back OETH, and they have maintained their peg quite well since launch. They have also demonstrated significant growth in circulating supply, so the Origin team is confident that the 3 LSTs will maintain their peg and that OETH will remain stable to ETH. To ensure accurate pricing at all times, OETH is using Chainlink oracles for pricing data for rETH and stETH, and a dual oracle for frxETH that combines two sources: the Curve frxETH/ETH EMA oracle and the Uniswap frxETH/FRAX TWAP oracle. In situations where any OETH collateral falls below peg, [OIP-4 disables minting](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin-dollar/issues/1000) of additional OETH tokens using the de-pegged asset.\n\n*Slashing risk* - Since OETH is collateralized by multiple LSTs at the same time, OETH is protected from slashing from any individual collateral LST. If there is a small slash, the OETH yield will simply decrease, as income will likely exceed the size of the slash. During a major slashing event, both the slashed LST and OETH will experience a drop in value relative to ETH, but OETH should not fall as low and for as long as the slashed LST, as the remaining un-slashed OETH LSTs will soften the blow. There will never be a negative OETH rebase.\n\n*Smart contract risk of OETH* - Origin is taking every step possible to be proactive and lessen the chance of losing funds. Security reviews are prioritized over new feature development, with regular audits being done, and multiple engineers are required to review each code change with a detailed checklist. There are timelocks before protocol upgrades are launched, and deep dives into the exploits of other protocols are constantly being done to make sure the same exploits don’t exist on Origin contracts. Security is extremely important to the Origin team. OETH was built reusing 95% of the OUSD code, of which 10+ audits have been done since 2020. All audits can be seen on [Audits - OETH](https://docs.oeth.com/security-and-risks/audits) , and OpenZeppelin is now on retainer. On-chain insurance protocol InsurAce awarded OETH and OUSD the [highest possible security rating of AAA](https://app.insurace.io/coverage/buycovers), of which only 3 other projects on the InsurAce platform have received. Optional OETH cover is currently available for both OETH and OUSD on InsurAce. Origin Defi also maintains a $1m bug bounty through [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/explore/), with a resolution time of 7 hours. \n\n\nExternal OETH analysis:\n\n[Llama Risk](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/asset-risk-assessment-origin-ether) - Asset Risk Assessment: Origin Ether (OETH)\n[Auxo](https://mirror.xyz/auxo.eth/1NXxHhJmj44EfHmvA5pEH7mpSLtg-CbYRqmuEkaTRRk) - OETH - Protocol Analysis\n\n\nOETH in the news:\n\n[Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/16/origin-protocol-enters-competitive-ether-yield-market-with-oeth-offering/) - Origin Protocol Enters Competitive Ether Yield Market With OETH Offering \n[TokenInsight](https://tokeninsight.com/en/news/origin-protocol-launches-yield-aggregating-eth-derivative-called-oeth) - Origin Protocol Launches Yield Aggregating $ETH Derivative Called $OETH \n[Blockster](https://blockster.com/maximize-eth-staking-yields-with-oeth-a-yield-bearing-ether-pegged-token-by-origin-protocol) - Maximize ETH Staking Yields with OETH: A Yield-Bearing, Ether-Pegged Token by Origin Protocol \n\n**Closing Thoughts**\n\nPeter is a core member of [Origin Protocol](https://originprotocol.com/) and is joined by the fully doxxed Origin team and community, which includes hundreds of thousands of members and open-source contributors. Many members of the Origin team, including both founders, are holding a significant portion of their personal wealth in OETH. Origin Protocol’s corporate treasury is also holding millions of dollars in OETH. We have skin in the game and are willing to put our own money at risk with the code we have written.\n\nThere are no lockups with this proposal, Nouns can move in and out of OETH as the Nouncil, core team, DAO, and community desires. OETH remains completely liquid at all times, and can be spent in the same way as its backing collateral, if unexpected expenses were to arise.\n\n",

It is purely Defi\n\n- Audits, audits, audits \n\n- 10+ audits have been done on the OETH codebase, and more are being done right now with OpenZeppelin on retainer. View the audits here- https://bit.ly/OETHaudits\n\n- The OETH codebase is 95% of the OUSD codebase, which has been live since January 2020 with no issues\n\n- No energy is required from Nouns to hold OETH, or manage an OETH position - OETH is designed to be passive \n\n- It would require only half as much ETH as stETH to earn the same amount of yield.

The New York evening view is the best place to take photos while wearing Noggles.\n- **[October 2023 to April 2024]** Support two Olympic sailors during the qualification rounds for the Paris Olympics.\n    - In 2024, all the focus will be on the Summer Paris Olympics. I propose to sponsor two Olympic athletes and explore opportunities for organic sponsorship to promote Noggles in the Olympics.\n- **[October 2023 to September 2024]** Road to the J/24 World Sailing Championship in Seattle, WA\n    - Continue building the legacy and traditions of Nouns Burgee Flags by sending sailing teams to compete at the J/24 World Sailing Championship, the highest level of competition in sailing!\n\n# Description\nI, fiveoceans, have enjoyed the art of sailing for over a decade. Recently, I've seamlessly combined my passion for sailing with my deep affection for Nouns, crafting sailing events in both Seoul and New York, with the generous support of Props 102 and 173. Sailing, often hailed as one of the most esteemed sports, never fails to attract the attention of the media, guests, and local residents alike.\n\nIn much the same way that Nouns effortlessly align with cultures centered around skateboarding and running, they also harmonize beautifully with sailing culture. While sailing may be less popular or perceived as more challenging to engage in, it stands as one of the most inclusive sports, welcoming individuals of all ages, backgrounds, and walks of life.\n\nI am eager to extend my love for sailing to the Nouns community by curating a series of sailing events throughout 2024. These gatherings will provide a splendid opportunity to gather and share our ideas about future of NounsDAO.\n\n# Why Nouns Sailing?\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJjKkJqun.jpg)\nThe Nouns burgee flag debuted at the 2023 Nouns Sailing event during NFT.NYC, representing the spirit of Nouns and the tradition of the Nounish community. Sailing isn't just a sport; it's a symbol of dedication and camaraderie. Sailors are the ones we can entrust with building the legacy and traditions of the Nouns Burgee Flag.\n\n## 1. Sail with Nouns in New York Harbor for NFT.NYC 2024\n**[April 3rd, 2024]** Following the success of [Prop 102](https://nouns.wtf/vote/102) and [Prop 173](https://nouns.wtf/vote/173), I would like to organize a sailing event on April 3rd in New York with the help of the Manhattan Yacht Club. It is important to gather at least once a year to celebrate achievements, brainstorm ideas, and share thoughts. I believe New York is the best place for such gatherings. In April, it was an amazing experience to meet everyone for the first time in person. I think next year, we will have even more loyal people visiting New York.\n\n\n## 2. Support two Olympic sailors\n**[September 2024]** In 2024, all eyes will be on the Summer Paris Olympics. It presents a unique opportunity for us to showcase noggles during this prestigious event. Rather than simply purchasing advertisements, I suggest a more organic approach – sponsoring Olympic athletes. My hypothesis is that by supporting these athletes during the qualification season, they will appreciate our assistance and, in turn, proudly display noggles at the Olympic games.\n\nShould this initiative prove successful with sailors, we can explore extending our sponsorship to athletes in various other sports. My initial proposal is to sponsor two Olympic sailors during their qualification season. The Olympic Sailing Competition at Paris 2024 will comprise ten sailing events, with a total athlete quota of 330. Qualification rounds commenced in August 2023 and will continue until April 2024.\n\n## 3. Road to J/24 World Sailing Championship\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7uN5xdw.jpg)\nThe J/24 World Sailing Championship stands as one of the most prestigious international sailing competitions. Our preparations for this championship will span an entire year. By fielding teams to compete in the J/24 World Championship, we aim to introduce Nouns to a diverse audience with different backgrounda encompassing professional sailors, Olympic medalists, seasoned veterans, all-female teams, collegiate squads, dedicated enthusiasts, teenagers, and newcomers who share a passion for sailing J/24 boats.\n\nOur goal is to bring the Nouns community along on this journey to the J/24 World Championship! This event represents the pinnacle of sailing competition, and every sailor aspires to participate (List of J/24 championships - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J/24_World_Championship)). All teams involved will take immense pride in representing Nouns on such a grand stage.\n\nThroughout the year, we will engage in rigorous training and proudly display Nouns-themed spinnakers in various cities across Korea. We have identified some of the most picturesque locations, including beaches, islands, and areas with industrial landscapes.\n\nTo further promote Nouns, we commit to maintaining an active presence on social media platforms. Sending teams to compete at this prestigious event presents a remarkable opportunity to raise awareness of Nouns.\n\nOur dedication extends beyond the competition; we plan to work tirelessly throughout the year to promote Nouns. Regular updates on social media will offer insights into our practices, races, and maintenance routines. We'll showcase the elegance of Nounish spinnakers, whether in leisurely cruises or intense competitions. Additionally, we'll allocate time to master sailing maneuvers that may be less familiar to us as racers, such as figure sailing and cascade formations, which promise captivating visuals for photos.\n\n### Meet the Teams\n1.

      "description": "# NFTR: The First Ethereum Protocol Run by a Nounish DAO\n\n# TLDR\n\nNFTR, the first and only NFT Naming Registry on Ethereum, is requesting 80 ETH to seed its Nounish DAO Treasury. In Nounish DAO fashion, 1 daily NFT = 1 vote,  will determine NFTR funding initiatives. In return for the funding, Nouns DAO will receive 10% of the supply in perpetuity. In addition, NFTR will direct 5% of daily auction proceeds to the Nouns DAO treasury up to 80 ETH.\n\nNFTR allows naming any ERC-721 with a globally unique name across all Ethereum.\n\nNFTR DAO will eternally proliferate Nouns as sponsor of the NFT Naming standard. \n\nThe up and coming standard -- [ERC-6551](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6551)’s Token-Bound Accounts turn NFTs into active onchain identities that can do anything an EOA / smart contract wallet can do. Active NFTs and their accounts need human-readable names for reference and reach.\n\nThis initiative expands Nouns’ addressable market to **all NFT holders**.\n\n# Who's Behind NFTR?\n\n[DigitalOil](https://x.com/0xdigitaloil) is the founder and CEO of [NFTR](https://nftr.name). Team includes 1 BD lead, COO, 2 more devs, and a designer. Development began in Q3 2021. Before going full-time web3, DigitalOil was an iOS developer, satcom engineer, and logistics business executive. He was behind [Prop 199](https://nouns.wtf/vote/199) and worked on [Private Voting](https://prop.house/nouns/private-voting-research-sprint/3976) (recently won the Nouns Private Voting contest) Research funded by Nouns. DigitalOil also recently founded [The Panama DAO](https://twitter.com/ThePanamaDAO), in the image of Nouns DAO, which was pre-seeded 1 ETH by [Nouns Prop House](https://prop.house/nouns/open-round:-12/2166) and subsequently seeded 20 ETH by a [Builder DAO Incubator round](https://prop.house/builder/dao-incubator-round-2).\n\nFor more on DigitalOil’s thoughts about Nouns, please refer to his Nouns Agora statement.\n\nNote that DigitalOil has fronted all NFTR founding expenses (over $400k worth) since inception, ~19 months ago. NFTR has never raised seed funding.\n\n# What is NFTR?\n\nNFTR (NFT Registry) is a universal, permissionless NFT Naming Registry on Ethereum.\n\nNFTR allows naming any ERC721 with a globally unique name across all NFTs.\n\nIt's comparable (albeit different architecturally) to ENS for naming NFTs instead of wallets.\n \nNaming an NFT grants the NFT a NFTR Profile with soon to be integrated ERC-6551 functionality (a new standard for Token Bound Accounts) and extensive utility. \n\nNFTR provides an API so that any platform can pull and display names alongside NFTs.\n\nFor more details on protocol architecture, visit [NFTR.name](https://nftr.name) to view our [Docs](https://docs.nftr.name), try our live dApp, view NFTR Profiles at [name].NFTR.name, or engage on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/frMSHsAvay).\n\n![*Nouns that have been named on NFTR.

JellO can be interacted with by visiting jello.nftr.name in any web browser.* \n\n# Why name NFTs?\n\nNFTs need the accessibility afforded by simple, unique names.\n\nThe rise of ERC-6551 Token Bound Accounts accelerates the inevitable onchain use of NFTs as our identities.\n \nA universal NFT Naming Registry unlocks limitless NFT-centric app potential, hosted within NFTR Profiles, allowing you to BE your NFT. \n\n**Current \"web3\" ID jumble**\n* A Twitter account with an off-chain handle\n* Ubiquitous profile name featuring reference to an unverifiable on-chain domain (ENS or NNS)\n* A verified or unverified image of an NFT that’s impossible to refer or navigate to\n\nAll representing a web2 account who may not own the displayed NFTs or domains.\n\n**NFTR Names and Profiles provide**\n* Cohesion of NFT, onchain identity, and social media\n* Instant reference/reach via a simple domain: [name].nftr.name\n* Organized ERC-6551 functionality, 1 subdomain per Token-Bound Account. \n* NFT Utilities: listed below\n\nFor an expanded vision behind NFTs as identities, refer to [this article](https://medium.com/blockchain-biz/on-web3-digital-identity-ies-480e2257a706) by DigitalOil.\n\n![Current profile page of JellO. Previously owned by our Treasury (at time of naming). Now owned by mucholove.eth.

This Noun is reachable at jello.nftr.name*\n\n# NFTR Utility\n\nNFTR Names unlock usage of NFTs as our identities. NFTR Profiles at [name].nftr.name facilitate and embed the following utilities (**bold** still under development):\n\n* Simple NFT reference + reach\n* Web3 verified links to socials + NFT marketplaces (showing best available price)\n* **ERC-6551 Integration (Token-Bound Accounts)**\n* **Subdomain per Token-Bound Account**\n* NFTR Name Marketplace (name trading)\n* **NFT Direct Messaging (between NFTs)**\n* Composability: New primitive for dApps to leverage\n* **Collection-native utilities and plugins into NFTR Profiles**\n\n![Verified socials (verified twitter handle shown). Allows for the first time for an NFT to point to a social media identity, inter-relating them both ways.](https://i.imgur.com/6zQ32bc.png)\n*Verified socials (verified twitter handle shown). Allows for the first time for an NFT to point to a social media identity, inter-relating them both ways.*\n\nIntegration of ERC-6551 features will operate a named NFT’s TBAs (Token-Bound Accounts) and associate them with a subdomain, making the TBA reachable by referring to the subdomain (e.g. banking.DigitalOil.nftr).\n\n![The NFTR Name Marketplace allows for trading NFT names.](https://i.imgur.com/UnUzHIP.png)\n*The NFTR Name Marketplace allows for trading NFT names.*\n\nAs an extension of an NFT's naming history, NFTR will develop the first NFT-event specific indexer. The indexer searches and detects all events related to an NFT, including:\n* Contract provenance\n* Mint date\n* Naming history\n* Wallet to wallet transfers\n* NFT enhancements / metadata changes\n* App specific events, like airdrop claims\n* Uses of the NFT as collateral\n* Using the NFT for some collection-specific utility (e.g. Mutating a BAYC)\n* Staking the NFT for yield\n* All of the above with the intent of making NFTR into the first NFT-centric identity platform, where NFTs become social and are front and center.\n\n# Why involve NounsDAO?\n\nDistributing ownership of the contracts and treasury of an Ethereum-wide primitive to a decentralized DAO is the ultimate proliferation of Nouns: perpetuating the ideal on-chain governance model.\n\nWe view Nouns as the purest instantiation of a DAO and are interested in adopting the Nouns DAO model for control and proliferation of the NFTR protocol.\n\nNFTR has been bootstrapped to date. A funding infusion will accelerate development at a critical time, facilitate NFTR’s first marketing efforts, and permit other initiatives to cement NFTR into its sensible role as a necessary and universally adopted public good. \n\nThe Nouns community is full of individuals concerned with innovation and the welfare of web3. We’d be honored to enlist your support and advocacy, both as a Nouns brand and as a collection of highly sensible and web3 native individuals. \n\n# ERC-6551 Integration + Enhancement\n\nFrom ERC-6551's [whitepaper](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6551#abstract):\n\nERC-6551 Abstract: “This proposal defines a system which assigns Ethereum accounts to all non-fungible tokens. These token bound accounts allow NFTs to own assets and interact with applications, without requiring changes to existing smart contracts or infrastructure.”\n\nAnother quote: \"Each token bound account is owned by a single ERC-721 token, allowing the token to interact with the blockchain, record transaction history, and own on-chain assets. Control of each token bound account is delegated to the owner of the ERC-721 token, allowing the owner to initiate on-chain actions on behalf of their token.\"\n\nIf ERC-721s (NFTs) are to be so active, they must be simply and uniquely identifiable.\n\nENS, fundamentally, provides this service to Ethereum wallets.\n\nNFTR, natively, provides this service to NFTs and ERC-6551 Users.\n\nAs ENS provides limitless value and utility beyond reach/reference, so does NFTR. \n\n# NFT Name Integration\n\nNFTR Names can be easily integrated by ABI/API call into:\n* Existing NFT Marketplaces (show names below NFTs for sale)\n* Metaverse spaces\n* Web3 Games\n* Social media apps that display verified NFTs\n\nIntegrated NFTR Names are:\n\n* Quickly reachable by web domain at [name].nftr.name\n* Clickable, directing to NFTR Profile for direct interaction with the NFT\n* Interactive via NFT Messaging, direct payments, bidding, browsing NFT history, etc.\n\n# How Does NFTR’s namespace work?\n\nNFT Names are registered in NFTR’s [Registry Contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc662a8ce36392d4b9489d0b59605a1874711bfc6). They are unique, meaning that no two NFTs can simultaneously hold the same name. They are NOT tokens or NFTs themselves. This brings the following benefits:\n* NFTR Name transactions are light (not gas intensive)\n* NFT Names are bound to the NFT, and travel with the NFT\nNFTR’s native name marketplace facilitates free in-wallet name transfer and buying/selling/bidding between wallets. Names are integrated into existing dApps via API/ABI call.\n\nNames are alphanumeric strings with no leading or trailing spaces, and are case sensitive for display purposes. But case-insensitive for duplicity purposes.\n\n\n# Similar Props\n\n**107 Verse**: Narrowly passed before funds were returned. Conflicted results due to purchase of equity in a non-Nouns project (Verse). Relation to our prop: NFTR is requesting DAO funds, not selling equity. NFTR is Nounish in DAO structure, and will feature ⌐◧-◧ in daily NFTs. \n\n**189 SharkDAO**: “I see these types of proposals as \"cultural venture investments\", similar to our @nounsbuilder funding… we just need to know whether a) we trust that the subDAO will steward those funds in a way that is positive for Nouns DAO, and b) if the cumulative ask is an amount of our treasury we are comfortable \"locking up\" until we see the cultural ROI from that spending.” Relation to our prop: NFTR can be viewed as a venture investment, though all funds will be incrementally added to the NFTR DAO, and their usage will be determined by DAO members (20% NFTR team, 10% NounsDAO). As a contributing member of Nouns and an innovator in the space, it can be reasonably assumed that DigitalOil will be an admirable steward of NFTR and its association to the Nouns brand and DAO model. \n\n**284: PizzaDAO**: Executed prop to fund PizzaDAO’s global pizza party, featuring Nouns branding and Noggle props. Here, Nouns served as sponsor for another DAO’s mission while perpetuating the Nouns meme. Relation to our prop: Not only will Nouns’ branding be integrated into NFTR’s NFTs and platform; NFTR’s DAO structure will inherently mimic the ideal web3 standard established by NounsDAO, eternally perpetuating the meme and the model. \n\n# NFTR Revenue Model\n\nMultiple revenue streams that will flow to the NFTR DAO Treasury.\n* Paid Namings (0.01 ETH, one-time lifetime fee, adjustable by the DAO)\n* NFTR Marketplace Revenue (5% fee of name trade value, adjustable by the DAO)\n* Daily Nounish NFT Mints\n* Golden Ticket sale fees ([GTKs are an existing](https://www.nftr.name/#/golden-ticket) NFTR-created ERC-20 that token-gates NFTR’s top 1000 names)\n* Fees from eventual advanced NFTR features (NFT Groups, subdomains, etc.)\n\n# How NFTR will proliferate Nouns\n\n* Finish building a web3 standard in the model of Nouns DAO\n* Nounish governance NFTs\n* Nouns DAO will become a major contributor to the NFTR DAO\n* Nouns DAO maintains a significant influence (10% voting weight) over NFTR DAO props. Note that if Nouns chooses to exert this influence it would likely be by delegation to interested parties.\n\n# Deliverables\n\n* Adopt Nouns DAO governance structure (includes turning over ownership of the protocol contracts to the Nounish NFTR DAO) via Nouns Builder DAO deployment.\n\n![NFTR governance becomes Nounish](https://i.imgur.com/7qZ3KV5.png)\n*NFTR governance becomes Nounish*\n\n![Nouns profile pages on NFTR would show different than profile pages for other NFTs](https://i.imgur.com/o9GiXGg.png)\n* Nouns profile pages on NFTR would show different than profile pages for other NFTs\n* 10% of minted NFTs go straight to Nouns DAO treasury\n* 20% of minted NFTs are sent to the NFTR team address\n* 5% of minted NFTs go to a contract governed by [Golden Ticket](https://www.nftr.name/#/golden-ticket) holders\n* The other 65% of NFTs are auctioned daily with proceeds going 100% to the Treasury\n* Outfit our daily NFTs with ⌐◧-◧\n\n![NFTR DAO daily NFT early concept](https://i.imgur.com/VEJKMwI.png)\n*NFTR DAO daily NFT early concept*\n\nSupply every Nouns NFT (forever) with a Naming Credit (existing and future), good for a free name + associated NFTR Profile (accessible by [name].nftr.name).

      "description": "# PALACE X NOUNS\n\n![](https://imgur.com/AyEJ0vI.jpg)\n\n# **TLDR**\n\n•Fund the next four months to create a framework and legal agreement for Nouns and [Palace SkateBoards](https://www.instagram.com/palaceskateboards/) collaboration.\n\n• Lead by two members of the Synthetic team and Palace co-founder Gareth Skewis.\n\n• 4 months of operations\n\n• The collaboration will be built in **two phases**, legal and concept construction phase, and MFG execution.\n\n• This proposal aims to finance the project/legal that will organize everything for collaboration, as well as the construction of the concept/design/approach of the capsule. There is no physical delivery on this support.\n\n## **Concept**\n\nA defining underground force in menswear in the 2010s, Palace here echoes the new and weirdness of Nouns through a series of pieces that will hybridize their creative universes – inherently Italian, boldly new, translated anew. The initial inspiration will be built on the Palace catalog itself and on the undeniable influence of Nouns on nft culture.\n\n## **Introduction**\n\n[Palace Skateboards](https://www.instagram.com/palaceskateboards/) needs little introduction, but for the uninitiated, the London-based skateboarding and clothing brand has become a mainstay in the streetwear scene for incorporating 1990s and pop culture influences with their VHS-style clothing ads. In other words, it’s kitsch, cool, and everything in between.\n\n# **Why Palace?**\n\n[Palace](https://www.instagram.com/palaceskateboards/) began as a brand for skateboarders. It is now a brand for all. Models turn up for castings in Palace. Working class Glasgow dads sport Palace. Jay-Z wears Palace. So does Rihanna. Teenage girls sleep in Palace, dreaming of the heart-throbs they’ve seen wearing Palace online. 2018’s Wimbledon finalists played on court in Palace. Soundcloud rappers adore Palace. The ICA exhibits Palace. Serious DJs with peerless techno collections adorn their record boxes with Palace stickers. Ravers ingest ecstasy pills produced in the shape of Palace’s Tri-Ferg logo. Socio-political causes, including the plights of both Jeremy Corbyn and the people of Palestine, have been smartly memed in versions of the Palace triangle.\n\nA middle-aged architect can slyly intimate he has better kids than his colleagues by picking something up at Palace, even if it’s just their socks. Virgil Abloh and Marc Jacobs wear Palace. London tube station walls are adorned by carriage-length adverts for Palace. The bigwigs at Ralph Lauren were so taken by the irrepressible rise of Palace that Palace became its first ever collaborator in 50 years of singularly myth-making fashion history.\n![](https://imgur.com/dlwqvv6.gif)\n![](https://imgur.com/OEHdbcQ.jpg)\n![](https://imgur.com/KsVOGlC.gif)\nFashion’s favourite photographers Alasdair McLellan, Juergen Teller and David Sims shoot for Palace. Silicon Valley is full of people in Palace. Blue-chip stylists buy Palace from their own pocket money to lend their imagery some of the company’s off-rail styles and indigenous London magic. i-D and British Vogue carry Palace ads. Madonna and child (Rocco) have been photographed proudly wearing Palace. All the while, a fat lad on a Midlands housing estate is looking great and feeling even greater in Palace while waiting for his Chinese takeaway and playing Fortnite.\n\n## Strength in Numbers\n\nThe large take on several already-created collaborations and communication from other brands to the nft audience is an excellent entry point for the brand to reach fans and a new market. Likewise, for the Nouns community;  **significant increases in brand awareness, favorability for further collaborations, and open public interest in the brand, consequently becomes a win-win.** To highlight the ROI of the collaboration, let's look at promoting the Palace brand among your collaborations;\n\n[Gucci](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CjsKDzipOtF), [Mercedes](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CbXyjVPq0VI), [New Balance](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cr-s3WotGz1), [Adidas](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CoHewHju2Ii), [RIMOWA](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CoUlcMeqvAs), and many others.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/qCpbrcS.jpg)\n[PALACE JAPAN MAGAZINE](https://www.palaceskateboards.com/range/spring-2019/palace-japan-magazine/)\n\n**Approach**: Use public communication-powered resources to compare social media posts containing mentions of the Palace and Nouns brand, before and after the partnership.\n\"Outcome: Insight into the Marketing ROI of an NFT Dive from Palace\" **“ Significantly increases the reach of Nouns by talking to two sets of customers instead of one and gives a signal from one brand that the other brand is trusted by the upscale market.”**\n\n# **Phase One and Phase Two.**\n\n![](https://imgur.com/liP7MrS.jpg)\n\nDetailed legal processes and collaboration building over the next four months; **Phase one**\n\n• Recitals\n• Purpose\n• Confidentiality Clause\n• Commercial Clause\n• Investment Clause\n• Duties and Obligations of Collaborators\n• Reporting and Project Management\n• Intellectual Property Rights\n\n• Fashion product mix;\n• Creation and style;\n• Prototyping;\n• Product development;\n• Marketing and Sales Strategy;\n• Collection management;\n• Evaluation of results.\n\nFor the scope of this proposal, Synthetic team is acting as the liason on behalf of the Nouns community and will adhere to all non-confidentiality & legal agreements relevant to Palace's collaboration workflow. Synthetic will work closely with the Nouns community to share public work-in-progress updates regularly which do not breach the above said agreements.\n\nSynthetic is a mediator, and nouns have a proactive CC0 license, In short Palace would not need Synthetic for commercial construction, what we are doing is raising ideas and presenting about the Nouns ecosystem: the various subgroups, the vibe, and the importance.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/ObE6wW9.jpg)\n![](https://imgur.com/sC8GwqP.jpg)\n\n## Breakdown of legal conditions\n\n**Strategy**: Legal terms and already transcribed collaboration construction.\n\n(the terms below will be robustly written to avoid legal inconvenience)\n\n![](https://imgur.com/fPYHHdj.jpg)\n\n• Recreate the look and feel of the Palace collaborative product; designing new products for that collaboration; concentrated on multiple tacit marketing and management ideas that they share.\n\n• Synthetic and the built committee will be responsible for co-managing the community outreach and communication campaign during construction.\n\n• Creative control, both teams have to work within the decided parameters and cannot go beyond that and after each step, they must report to the other brand.\n\n• Marketing strategies will be created and built exclusively by the Palace team's design and construction team. (This is due to several cordial agreements that the brand already has with the media – Vogue, WWD, Hypebeast and others.)\n\n• Nouns Palace limited edition products will be restricted to online sales.\n\n# **Palace Nouns: What to expect**\n\nThe special line is a connection to the “new” and will feature easter eggs throughout to make each piece truly special. The icing on the cake? Palace will launch women's ready-to-wear designs, making this collaboration one for all genders. The build will be designed to be a capsule of 5 distinct items. Because both aesthetics have been merged, expect logos to do the same.\n\nOn Palace’s classics – we're talking tracksuits, jeans, football shirts, skate decks – you'll see the Nouns identity scattered throughout. You’ll see this synergy on other more luxurious pieces, like a shearling jacket, as well as other unusual collectibles.\n\nAnother surprise for collectors is noggles Palace – a witty homage to the ‘weird’ collection, if you will. The idea came up and its design is about to be created as a double brand, wrapped in the Palace Nouns monogram.\n\n## Palace Nouns: What will be delivered with the execution of phases two and one\n\nEntitled “Palace Nouns,” the capsule – comprises statement-making garments designed for the collaboration. Jackets, noogles palace, vests, and skateboard decks are some of the pieces that are designed to be present, all adorning the new graphics, intertwined with the unmistakable details of Palace and Nouns.\n\nGlobal communication, Palace maintains a standardization of communication between its clients to build and launch a new collaboration; In their coverage, many media outlets go into significant detail about their collaborations and make them public globally.\n\n• Looking ahead: Building a capsule\n\nA capsule collection is essentially a condensed version of a designer's vision/collaboration, often in limited edition, that transcends seasons and trends by being functional. Thus, focusing on building and delivering key looks, without the style and theatricality of a fashion show.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/5qLsHLr.jpg)\n\n**Nouns Palace will be a 5-item capsule.**\n\n**a % (percentage) of collection sales will be directed to the NounsDAO Treasury.**\n\n## Building in public\n\n**There is no precedent for similar proposals in Nouns**, a collaboration like this creates demand for interaction and content that can be used by other builders and future collaborations.\n\nMany of the processes built to reach an agreement with a corporate are extremely tiring and even building their direction and a good presentation, most corporations prioritize closed and legal agreements to add clauses and prioritize their Intellectual Property.\n\n• Create a [general structure](https://mirror.xyz/0x905Ca7a9479EA1B9a8CDeD74da98e3CC5E6E2949) together with lawyer consulting to detail the collaboration and develop material to serve as a reference for other builders.\n\n• Unfortunately, the fashion collaborations have had terrible results in Nouns. What makes this different?\n\nYes, we are aware that we have seen several proposals without any results, this creates a history for the community to reject future approaches in the same segment, but the work we are building is extremely detailed to avoid any interruption or lack of communication. Open and detailed communication framework, creation of the capsule aimed at the general public and construction of an official approach.\n\nBuilding an official approach aims to contain everything that is expected from collaboration and has never been met;\n\n•Campaign\n•Communication published on the Palace's official social media containing a pre-announcement of the launch date.\n•Sending email newsletters to existing customers, with previews of collaboration lookbooks.\n•Mainstream coverage, Palace is known for the buzz it creates when announcing its collaborations, due to the coverage and attention its clients and media outlets create.\n\nCollaboration is the combination of numbers and audience as well as the introduction to a new group of clients. **When we mention that there are no precedents built for Nouns, we reaffirm.**\n\n**Accountability**\n\nForm a Steering Committee: composed of [DeGenData](https://twitter.com/degendata), [Ccarella](https://twitter.com/ccarella), [Oni-apenoun](https://twitter.com/apenoun) and 1 other noun who have intimate knowledge of the brands present in the collaboration.\n\nProvide this committee with **frequent updates on clauses, legal terms, construction and execution of the collaboration.**\n\n[Supriyo](https://twitter.com/next_roy) and [Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi) also made themselves available to help us by monitoring the execution of the collaboration framework and giving us closer feedback.\n\n# **What has been done so far?**\n\nWhat has been done so far?\n\nThe Synthetic project is somewhat similar to Nouns, they are both test projects, so the constant change is aimed at future research and long-term construction.\n\nSome of our achievements and experiments during this period;\n\n\n![](https://imgur.com/fYjLkWZ.jpg)\n\n![](https://imgur.com/YbbKqSa.jpg)\n\n![](https://imgur.com/QXeZfjv.jpg)\n\nIn several of our experiments with DAO we had constructions just for the meme without considering the funding request.\n\nA document is being built on the mirror detailing our experiments and will be available on our [Twitter.](https://twitter.com/synthetic_eth)\n\n![](https://imgur.com/aQHXdNh.jpg)\n\n# **FAQ**\n\n• Will there be any activation exclusively for noun holders?\n\nYes, In short - we will be designing the capsule with a variety of nouns specific perks in mind. Details will be defined during the ideation of the capsule.\n\n• Will the capsule be made available globally?\n\nYes, with the exception of one item that will be available exclusively in certain regions.\n\n• Will sales also be available in physical stores?\n\nNouns Palace limited edition products will be restricted to online sales.\n\n• Does this proposal cover actually creating the capsule? So the end result is ultimately Palace x Nouns clothes I can buy online?\n\nThis proposal covers the consolidation of legal terms, as well as the construction of the idealization/concept for creating the capsule. The construction with already defined direction and execution of the capsule will start in phase two (second support).\n\n## Funding Request\n\nOperations & Admin Compensation - €47.000\n\n• Compensation + fees for 4 Months of two full-time synthetic team members. €37.600\n**(€4700 per member/month)**\n\n• Legal expenses - €15400\nLawyer consulting on clauses clauses established by Palace\n\nTotal =\n**€62400**\n\n# **Conclusion**\n    \n• A collaboration is being established between Palace and Nouns.\n\n• The request for this support covers compensation for the next four months of the team and legal processes and the construction of the ideation and detailing of the designer's capsule/collection.\n\n• There is no physical delivery of this support.\n\n• Marketing strategies will be created and built exclusively by the Palace project team.\n\n• The importance of this collaboration for Nouns is absolute, where you have a conversation between two audiences, one of which is global.\n\n• The specific amount of mass production of capsule items is still under study and will be detailed in the second support raised for the second phase.\n\n\n# **Team:**\n\n[Synthetic](https://twitter.com/synthetic_eth): project dedicated to the creation and transmission connections. Through this model, Synthetic has already contributed to five projects for the Nouns.\n\n**Considering the inopportune timing and where much of the attention is being directed towards the fork. This proposal has been restudied and rewritten a few times in the last week with feedback from the community and the committee itself considering the current market.**\n\n**Questions or comments?

      "description": "# Season 3 Grants: Bring Back the Builders (Scene 1, Take 2) ⌐◨-◨ \n\n[![grants-szn-3-take-5-new-date.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/MTmRGYdS/grants-szn-3-take-5-new-date.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/zb33tKst)\n\n## **TLDR**\n\n**Let's start Nouns Season 3 off right by bringing back the builders and the good vibes with available, reliable, discretionary funding for passionate Nounish builders.**\n\n*Note on proposal revision from V1 [(Prop 364)](https://nouns.wtf/vote/364): We had not anticipated that the [Garden Proposal](https://nouns.wtf/candidates/0xae65e700f3f8904ac1007d47a5309dd26f8146c0-elect-24-nouns-gardeners-as-the-voting-body-for-nouns-prop-house-open-rounds) from Seneca and Noun 40 would come so soon and that there was also 60 ETH in PH budget yet to be dispersed via this new program. In the spirit of positive sum collaboration, we did not want to propose a total amount of PH funding that would be difficult to allocate to builders without diminishing returns. We also received some feedback recommending a reduced time scope to prove out MVP, and have taken this to heart as well. Ultimately, we do think there is room and need for some passionate parallel efforts when it comes to finding and funding good ideas in Season 3 of Nouns.*\n\n## **THE PROBLEM**\n\nNouns historically has used small grants and Prop House rounds to complement onchain proposals. The Small Grants Committee (later known as NSFW) and Prop House rounds had fueled considerable community contributions, propelling the protocol's momentum. But during the latter half of Nouns Season 2, obtaining small grants grew challenging. \n\nWe want to help patch this bug in the protocol, and bring back the Builder-forward Nounish Vibes that brought many of us here in the first place.\n\nWe are a trusted group of contributors in the ecosystem who are willing to collectively take on the challenge of running a dynamic and transparent Small Grants Allocation Pod, as well as coordinating and championing a series of exciting biweekly Prop House Rounds over the next 3 months of Nouns Season 3. \n\n[![s2-noggles.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/W4SHH2bj/s2-noggles.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/SX2dXbMt)\n\n## **THE PLAN**\n\n1. Coordinate with the Prop House team to set up two new \"Season 3 Grants\" Infinite Rounds, where anyone in the ecosystem can apply for retroactive funding up to a maximum of 5 ETH or proactive funding up to a maximum of 1 ETH. (Infinite Rounds are a newer piece of Prop House infra that allows orgs to deploy small grants funding in an organized and transparent way. See [Rug Radio Small Grants example here](https://prop.house/rug-radio-small-grants).) Our team will review grant applications on a rolling week-by-week basis, with a goal to allocate ~17 ETH per month, depending on submission quality.  \n\n2. Coordinate and trial a series of 3 monthly Themed Prop House Rounds with specific focuses such as “Visual Arts”, “Keep Nouns Weird”, “Gaming/Esports”, “CC0 Music”, “Public Goods,” “Media and Content\" (Final themes to be Voted on by the DAO.) We plan to explore various token-voting methods, engaging the wider nounish community in some cases with a strong consideration for maintaining as much sybil protection as possible.\n\n3. Maintain a [Public-facing Discord](https://discord.gg/zY7jpzKwEN) and consistent messaging in the Farcaster Nouns channel, for community members to ask questions and receive feedback on their applications, while also using Prop House’s built-in comment functionality to provide ongoing transparent, public feedback on builder ideas as well.  \n\n4. Publish a public summary of funds deployed for full transparency and accountability.\n\n## **THE PEOPLE**\n\nFor an important program like this, it is essential to have a team that is 1) Known and Trusted, 2) Knowledgeable and Experienced About the Ecosystem and 3) Reliable at Execution.\n\nThe proposing team has all been active and trusted contributors to Nouns for 1+ years minimum, have an intimate knowledge of the Nouniverse, and have all delivered on past projects.\n\n*Core Team Will Include:*\n* [Al409](https://twitter.com/al409eth)\n* [BradQ](https://twitter.com/iambradq)\n* [Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi)\n* [ChrisCoCreated](https://twitter.com/ChrisCoCreated)\n* [Joshua Fisher](https://twitter.com/JoshuaFisher)\n* [Maty](https://twitter.com/matyETH/)\n* [Prof Werder](https://twitter.com/ProfWerder)\n* [Sasquatch](https://twitter.com/PartSasquatch)\n* [SuperTightWoody](https://twitter.com/SuperTightWoody/)\n* [Tha Swami](https://twitter.com/tha_swami) and his daughter [Lil Purple Blueberry](https://twitter.com/lilpurpberry)\n* [Toady Hawk](https://twitter.com/toady_hawk)\n\nTeam will only be compensated based on individual participation via Coordinape rounds every month allocated by participating team members and will rotate through responsibilities. Funds will be managed in a 3/6 Multisig. \n\n**All decisions on funding will be made by committee vote with a reasonable quorum and never at any one team member’s sole discretion. We will seek input from Nouners on Discord and Farcaster early and often. If there are not enough good applications via Infinite Rounds to warrant the budgeted ETH, we will be mindful to stretch the funding beyond the 3 month mandate, or will return excess to the DAO. Members of the team will not be eligible for funding from either the Infinite Rounds or the S3G Prop House Rounds.**\n\n\n## **THE PRICE**\n\n- Season 3 Small Grants Infinite Rounds: 50 ETH\n- Trial of 3 Monthly Themed Prop House Rounds: 30 ETH\n- Admin: 25 ETH \n    - (Admin Expense Ratio: 23%)\n\n**Total Program Cost: 105 ETH**\n\n## **THE PAYOFF**\n\nIt has been quite some time since we have seen the Nouns ecosystem buzzing with the energy of artists and creatives, the insights of talented developers and the vibes of passionate proliferators. \n\nWe will put our reputations on the line and bring our considerable skills and dedication to bear to allocate these DAO funds as effectively and transparently as possible to the most passionate and deserving builders, coders and creatives in the Nouniverse. \n\nRecent Prop House campaigns run by BASE and ThankApe have shown that there are still thousands of builders in the ecosystem, who are hungry for opportunities. \n\n**We don’t want Nouns to miss out on capturing that creative energy in Season 3 and want to be a collaborative part of the solution.**\n",

Thus, this program would help mature ideas and prevent voter fatigue.\n\nIn my opinion, grants of this nature would serve as a valuable complement to the existing funding mechanisms.

Each ~10 Min.\n* Produce storyboards and design physical assets required for production including puppets for new characters, sets, props, clothing, etc.\n* Complete stop motion animation.\n* Animate 2d elements and composite episodes.\n* Distribute finalized episodes at film festivals, streamers and events.\n\n**Phase 1**: 50% (400,000 USD) of funding due upon execution. \n* Completion of development, scripts, pre-production, animatics, set designs and puppets.\n* Timeline for completion: 6 Months\n\n**Phase 2**: 50% (400,000 USD) due upon completion of Phase 1.\n* Completion of animation, compositing, post-production, marketing and distribution.\n* Timeline for completion: 6 Months\n\n*Funds for Phase 1 transferred to Ed Balloon LLC upon execution. A proposal for Phase 2 will be submitted upon completion of Phase 1.*\n___\n![](https://imgur.com/n7sKJXh.jpg)\n\n# Series Creative Overview\n\n## SERIES LOGLINE\n\nMeet Ed B “The Puppet”. He’s a fatalistic struggling music artist just trying to make it. Everyday Ed B faces a new challenge – having to fight off racists at Trader Joes while perusing the vegan aisle, or running butt ass naked for a couple of dollars to pay his rent, OR having to sell photos of himself on the internet to help fund his next record – BUT they never stop him from pushing towards his dream of becoming the Beyoncé of puppets.\n\n## FORMAT\n\n* 10-12 minute web(3)isode\n* Stop motion and mixed media animation.\n\n___\n![](https://imgur.com/aah6X7X.jpg)\n# Pilot Episode\n\n## SYNOPSIS\n\n“A Song About Black Love” - Infatuated by a blossoming love interest, Ed B works out a new song about the joys of Black love. Billy, Ed’s bandmate, roommate and white ally, questions a hidden secret within Ed’s relationship and mayhem ensues.\n\n## FUNDING\n\n“A Song About Black Love” was self funded by Ed Balloon in 2022 primarily through the sale of NFTs. The tentpole fundraising project was the Run Ed Collection, a first-of-its-kind generative sound and motion NFT project that blended stop-motion, 2D and 3D animation, and music. Ed Balloon dropped the 1000 piece collection and it sold out, kickstarting production of the pilot. To help uplift other artists, Ed Balloon pledged 50 percent of the collection’s secondary sales toward The Ed Balloon Generational Wealth Fund, which collects work from Black and other under-represented artists in Web3.\n\n## CAST\n\n**Ed B “The Puppet”** | Ed Balloon\n**Billy** | Seth Green (Robot Chicken, Family Guy)\n**Peggy** | Blair Socci (Comedian)\n**Savannah** | Destiny Lavigne\n___\n# Nouns Integration in New Episodes\n\nThe possibilities for Nouns integration within the Ed B The Puppet universe are infinite. Noggles can be introduced as unique accessories that Ed and Billy can interact with, enabling them to solve problems or embark on new adventures. Noun characters could even make an appearance, bringing a sense of curiosity, wonder, or even magical qualities to the narrative.\n\n___\n![](https://imgur.com/Rw9HCbF.jpg)\n# Project Objective\n\n## Amplify Diversity\n\nBy creating content that celebrates and embraces diversity, we can showcase a wide array of perspectives and experiences. The Ed B ‘The Puppet’ Show will feature characters from different backgrounds, challenging stereotypes and fostering empathy among audiences. Through collaboration with the Nouns, we aim to elevate the visibility of diverse voices and promote a more inclusive entertainment landscape.\n\n## Utilize Satire for Social Commentary\n\nSatire serves as a powerful tool for social commentary, allowing us to address pertinent societal issues in a thought-provoking and engaging manner. By employing satire, we can challenge the status quo, stimulate critical thinking, and spark conversations that lead to positive change. Our collaboration with the Nouns will provide a platform for satirical content that encourages viewers to question and reconsider established norms.\n\n## Promote Collaboration and Solidarity\n\nOur project embraces the spirit of collaboration within the web3 community. By partnering with the Nouns, we aim to showcase the power of collaboration in amplifying diverse voices and driving innovation. Through cross-platform promotions, joint marketing initiatives, and immersive fan experiences, we can create a unified front that promotes solidarity within the industry. We will be using noun features (Noggles, characters, etc) in these episodes.\n\n___\n![](https://imgur.com/LGpjxXz.jpg)\n# Creative Team\n\n## Ed Balloon [Series Creator & Creative Director]\n\nSpearheading cultural representation and identity through his music and digital art, Ed Balloon has solidified himself not only as a Web3 artist and musician but also as a community leader.  Known for his innovative approach to music making, dynamic production style, and unique blend of electronic, hip-hop, and R&B, his 2022 Run Ed collection was presented as a one-of-a-kind generative sound and motion endeavor that blended stop-motion, 2D and 3D animation, and music. To help uplift other artists, 50 percent of the collection’s secondary sales continued to go toward The Ed Balloon Generational Wealth Fund, which collects work from Black and other under-represented artists in Web3. The pioneering musician also recently self-funded through the sale of NFTs the stop motion animated satire \"A SONG ABOUT BLACK LOVE.”  Executive produced by Daveed Diggs and starring Ed alongside actor Seth Green, the film showcases the difficulties of finding love as a black puppet.

Wwe opted not to fund 100k to be a title sponsor and named producer for an award winning documentarian last year --> there's less track record here and 5-8x the cost depending on whether we fund Phase 1 or both Phase 1 and 2. The vote for that film was 6 for to 128 against.  https://nouns.wtf/vote/232\n\nEd Balloon has an NFT collection (https://opensea.io/collection/run-ed) from April 2022 that raised 120 ETH to fund a 10 minute pilot, he's committed to the Web3 world Nouns is in. But we've only got this short trailer to see as example work from that funding.  This ask is more than that one which wasn't yet been completed or is not viewable yet.  \n\nSo I'd 1) to see the full work delivered from the previous non-Nouns raise and 2) to have more of a sense of what it would mean to make Nouns central to an episode and 3) to start much smaller no matter what.\n\nThanks for the Proposal, love the stop motion, and good luck.",

I mean look at that Roger Rabbit still. What are Roger and Eddie looking at? What’s about to happen? And why are they handcuffed together?! Not to mention location, costumes, use of lighting or even the colors! There’s a palpable tension and curiosity in that single frame that makes us **care**. \n\nI want to bring that to a fun art project focused on a pair of Nouns - Chip and Benny - and their adventures in the - slightly (or sometimes *very*) heightened and over-the-top - world of ‘**Noun en Scène**’.\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreidmghr5rzmqwejtz5gwvnlmyrmnbzf7noty6mb5b7ykcgyqln5veu)\n\nThink of it as a cinematic one-shot storytelling project that takes our pixelated, digital little Nouns, turns them into real life ‘muppet’-like puppets and then throws them into film scenes with flesh and blood people.\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreieoo7k4u7uen4d7slr6kt7re2234xtivk7sybo3j4z72buzpgueju)\n(*cinematic scenes that make you ask questions and keep looking*)\n\nEvery one-shot tosses our sweet, little Nouns into a new dramatic scene where they're forced to deal with the crazy situation they've gotten themselves into by trying to help or do a good deed for a random human they've met. \n\nAnd through these scenic moments, the world of Chip, Benny and the 'Noun en Scène' project will grow, evolve and hopefully become something people want to see more of!\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreia25gd5kfdglu52e2jakou3luj4neyzse52jgeelpvti57o2jojwi)\n\nBy utilizing ‘muppet’-like characters mixed with real people and heightened, cinematically-lit scenes, the absurdity and beauty of life will become that much more stark, profound and hopefully very funny. \n\nTaking cues and paying homage to a variety of influences including Alex Prager, The Far Side, world cinema, the Kermitage Collection and many more, this project aims to utilize a couple Nouns to create captivating characters we just can’t get enough of. \n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeifed3xlopidln4j4mieislub2pq4txtoealf6cvswxew6f7dlsxky)\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreif6ubfkoutleoqfxdhqctt2cdqwuidral6csbcp2k74brj32ahdai)\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreieoelw5lordgtyffzqby2pwjfs6u6crdhagk4t24mjgqlxma2wqrq)\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreibkhnf5lwzniwisn7jgzyxmk6ujnenj7gozeib4j7whkgndu3thaa)\n\nChip and Benny are just a couple innocent, little guys trying to help and do good in the world, but instead they keep finding themselves entangled in situations way beyond their depth. \n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreihyboig23zcntxs4mhhqkwyeqfzb3nnj7kq7bsfbbf5nwdbbwxlvy)\n\n# **COOL. SO WHAT’S THE PLAN?**\n---\n\nThese shoots will be treated like an indie film production - the difference being that we are capturing **single shots** that tell full, rich stories while still requiring casting, makeup, lighting, location scouting/rentals, puppet styling etc. \n\nOn the casting front, while at first it will make sense to work with local working actors/models and friends, as the project gains traction and grows - or when I’m working on my next tv show - I think there is a fun way to bring known name actors into these scenes and add a whole other level of playfulness to the project. \n\nThe first step will be designing, modeling and manufacturing our Noun ‘muppets.’ **Luckily, I’ve gotten a very exciting collaborator on board for this!**\n\n# **PUPPET HEAP!**\n---\n[![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreifgehg3mxpwez6iwiptsiqciuhg4v447nskvqyts6aclxsyxwpqzq)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/agxY_pJwo8o?si=vKyoY-cGw9rH14NI)\n\n\n**Puppet Heap** is a unique design and production studio specializing in storytelling through the creation of iconic characters for all sorts of media including film, television, advertising, theater, and new media. The company was founded by artist, designer, filmmaker, and teacher Paul Andrejco after observing the burgeoning pile of puppets that had accumulated in his Hoboken apartment back in the early ‘90s. Now, just a few blocks away, Puppet Heap is home to teams of artists, designers, writers, and producers creating character based narratives for clients around the world including **The Walt Disney Company, Sesame Workshop, and Nickelodeon**. Puppet Heap has been entrusted with the care, maintenance, and creative support of the Muppets for Disney’s **The Muppets Studio** since 2006.\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeicf2f5r3nabecoodiso5baxyzi2gwafqaobj74ju22osfbvl7xxle)\n(*Puppet Heap team on set of Imagine Dragon's 'Radioactive'*)\n\nPuppet Heap loves the project - *I nounspilled them* - and will be joining to design and create the physical puppets of Chip and Benny. And as scale and scope continue to evolve in their journey (we have big plans), they’ll be there, helping to tell their growing story - and all the other Nouns that come into play too.\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreigg33zfrairgp6s7pp4ubxeqbub2aflalz744n6ux3czxoiwdhhfu)\n\n# **AWESOME! AND WHAT ABOUT ME?**\n---\n\nMy name is Chris Martin - not of Coldplay, sorry - and I’ve been making independent, global film and television productions for a decade plus now - primarily in Korea.\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreianc72wofibm66pb6cdpyhrxwkyvydmryhcdiqsc4w3zzycf6nqzi)\n\nMost recently, I co-created, co-wrote, directed, showran,and EP’ed 20 episodes of a show called 'Dramaworld' currently streaming on Amazon that stars well-known actors including Liv Hewson (‘Yellowjackets’, ‘Santa Clarita Diet’), Brett Gray (‘I’m a Virgo’, ‘On My Block’), Daniel Dae Kim (‘Lost’, ‘Hawaii 5-0’), Ha Jiwon (‘Secret Garden’) and K-pop star Henry Lau.\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreidcjuv6vkzugofvzyvr757lelpmvombyncr3pey7z7kndmjx2cd64)\n\nWith everything I create, I try to lean into **a playful, magical realist tone that’s grounded in heart**, which is the kind of storytelling that I think is not only a perfect fit for Nouns, but also an incredible way to bring people into this journey of Chip and Benny as they go around trying to help.\n\n\n\nI love everything about Nouns - the ethos, the support for creative, weird projects, and did I mention the freakin’ Noggles?! - and have been trying to figure out how I could do something creative that furthered that mission for quite awhile now. \n\nThen suddenly, while wandering around a street festival the other day, I saw this:\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreibrizjphslww7h46ya3f74alx2xunpxznggmmnd4f2mhmnp6sxmna)\n\n**And bingo! 💡**\n\nThe idea for ‘Noun en Scène’ landed fully formed in my brain! And I knew I had to make it a reality and see what it could eventually become!\n\n# **WHY SHOULD NOUNS FUND THIS?**\n---\n\nStorytelling is everything - always has been. And in a world where we are inundated with ‘content’ online, a playful, quirky and precise project like this will be a breath of fresh air to stand out against the noise.\n\nUtilizing photography as a medium and consistent characters as the subject will allow fans to come back, excited to see where the journey of Chip and Benny will lead and who they'll be trying to 'help' next. \n\nAnd by staging everything down to the last detail, each photographic story that comes out of ‘Noun en Scène’ will simultaneously be a fine art piece, a Sunday (web)comic and continuous character development leading to a broader (and very Noun-curious) audience. \n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreid2an66kifpojvxdzq4pjmnw5ix2cynbqhwemincxiclap2a65i3y)\n\nAnd in the spirit of '**mint everything**,' we are planning to utilize Zora to **mint and document our progress** - design sketches, scripts, behind the scenes, etc. It feels like a great way to document the process of creation and build something creative in public. \n\n# **Speaking of creative, meet Benny!**\nHere's Paul's initial design for Benny:\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeiad34c4vymsclagkv3jrfzag6hzuzpys5ttuqrpejtekgjjh7j27u)\n\nArms and legs, oh my! With our puppets, we want to keep what makes Nouns distinct while adding a whole new flavor that brings them to life and gives them character. \n\n### **The (mis)adventures of Chip and Benny** \nBy creating empathy and connection with our two little Nouns through **visual storytelling**, the project will help spread Nouns and nounish-ness far and wide - just how Chip and Benny would want it. \n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreib5bcbujje7cllcnu4f7iiwympjh3hdlk6tnctarnv7tmpl52gv4y)\n(*One-shot example sketch - 'Chip and Benny Check for- AHHHHH!'*)\n\nAnd we plan to have this first leg of the project culminate in a **fun droposal** that takes Chip and Benny IRL in eye-catching ways (*see below for a tease*). \n\n# **THE ASK AKA THE BUDGET**\n---\n\nWe want to propose a tight, but realistic budget that still allows us to execute this at the highest professional standards, so that we can first not only prove the concept, but create something that rivals the quality of anything you'd see in a high budget studio release. \n\nWe want to go above and beyond everyone’s expectations for what 'Noun en Scène' can be because seeing is believing and we think this initial batch of scenes will prove the potential of building out characters in a uniquely nounish way and make people want to see where we can go with Chip and Benny in the future. \n\n**BUDGET:**\n* **$40,000 USDC (2 puppets x $20,000 USDC/puppet)** **one-time cost** for the design and fabrication of our ‘Noun Muppets’ - this allows Puppet Heap to design, costume and build out Chip and Benny in their physical ‘muppet’-ish forms (**to be used again and again as the project continues and evolves**).\n* **$50,000 USDC** production budget to shoot and finish 5 'one-shots' - this will be a fully crewed up shoot with actors, set design, hair & makeup etc. and the budget will be used to pay crew, rent equipment, secure locations, finish photos in post etc. (all the production related expenses)\n* **Detailed breakdown** to give a general idea of how the funds will be used **[HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yym2vm-ojk9sXjrwziRHCDY6VYrSZPva3XBaryZLFUY/edit?usp=sharing)**\n* **1 NOUN post delivery** (*cookie head Noun 483*) - A big reason I want to do this is to become a more active and involved part of the Nouns community so I can more fully participate and build together with other Nouners\n\n**TOTAL BUDGET: $90,000 USDC + 1 NOUN (post delivery)**\n\n# **TIMELINE**\n---\n\nUpon prop passing, we can make our puppets and be in production in approximately **2.5 months** and aiming to have finished images ready **~1 month later**.\n\nAll the while **minting our progress and creative developments** on Zora.\n\n# **FUTURE STEPS**\n---\n\nMy aim for is to use the project to develop the characters and story of these two best friends on their journey to help and do good - even if it always seems to go a little sideways - in a surprising novel and onchain way. 'Noun en Scène' as the first piece will allow us to capture surprising, fun and shareable bitesize stories, which hopefully utimately brings Nouns into the real(ish) world and helps people fall in love with Chip and Benny.\n\nWhich brings me back to the aforementioned droposal! \n\nWhat better way to drum up curiousity than a **droposal** to help take Chip and Benny IRL. More on 👇 soon! \n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeihvxlu2d46qgru3qmlldtxluswjmujefg3k7vby6sdgb4cifyzmuy)\n(⌐◨-◨'s *on billboards?*)\n\n\nPaul and I have a ton of fun ideas for where to take this and how to grow it, so we're looking forward to what we can achieve this go round while keeping our minds open to how it can be expanded (*cough* a full blown live-action series *cough*).\n\nThank you for taking the time to read and look forward to making the world a little more Noun-ish!\n\n**Time for Chip and Benny to save the world. One good deed at a time!**\n\n*Keep Nouns weird.*\n\n-Chris",

I think nouns should be given as a prize to successful nouns prop builders (I always felt the noun given to salvino was fair and increased the appeal of nouns as a place to be a builder). like any good MMO it's great if items can be earned as well as bought, earned items offering meaningful status within the game.\n\nso I think it's much better to consider the noun as separate from proposal funding but a hard-to-attain but  possible if the prop REALLY delivers bonus (retroactive reward).\n\nfor that reason I'm voting in favor assuming that given the noun is not part of the onchain txs here, that the proposer would have to put up another prop after this prop is delivered and it would be put up to a vote as to whether the dao deems a nouns reward is warranted. I think that's a fair way for nouns rewards to be decided on with a high bar for success. ",

      "description": "# Nouns iOS Gov Client\n\nWe propose developing an iOS native app that enables Nouners to engage in governance activities on the go. We believe the app will enhance voter participation and democratize decision-making. The app will also serve as a valuable onboarding tool for new members and complement our existing governance clients. \n\n## Description\nWe have been developing an iOS app for NounsDAO. Our primary objective is to boost voter participation by providing Nouners with a user-friendly app that simplifies interactions with the Nouns protocol. We firmly believe that casting votes should be as effortless as sending a text message.\nThe core features will empower Nouners and community members to access the latest information and interact seamlessly with the Nouns protocol. Additionally, our experimental features will open doors to new onboarding methods, enhance community engagement and discover new utility. This app will be a valuable addition to existing governance clients, such as Nounsagora, Voter, Mmmogu, Nounoclock, Shenounigans, and many others.\n\n## Core Features List\n* Feed tab: Featuring the latest community, auction, trade, and proposal information in a clean and concise format.\n* Community tab: Providing an easy and concise way to find Nouners and delegates.\n* Auctions tab: Displaying the latest auction and market information from platforms like Opensea, LooksRare, Blur, etc.\n* Proposals tab: Read, track, and share proposals.\n* Wallet tab: Connect your wallet, check your Noun bags, cast and delegate votes (with Metamask, Rainbow, etc., integration).\n* Push notifications: A flexible notifications center for all activities, including notifications for specific trait minting, trades, delegations, etc.\n\n## Experimental Features\n* AirPlay support: Stream \"A Nouns Movie: Rise of Blus\" from the app to a monitor or TV.\n* Maps support: Display cities where Nouners and community members travel and reside (limited to locality).\n* NFTs: Distribute commemorative NFTs to active participants (those who check auctions more than three times a week receive a code to mint a unique Nounish NFT).\n\n## Timeline\n* Core features delivered in 1-2 months\n* Experimental Features in 4 months\n\n## Git repo\n* We welcome PRs at\nhttps://github.com/fiveoceans-dev/nouns-mobile/tree/main/ios-swift\n\n## Budget\n10 eth - UI design\n15 eth - retrofund\n30 eth - R&D next 5 months\n12 eth - maintanance ∞\n**Total: 67 eth**\n\n## Transaction\n\nSend 67 eth to [Five](https://twitter.com/fiveoceans_dev)\n0x7Bd4cdbD92ab09fA689ED899cddDD6ECCFeF7a54\n\n## Screenshots\n* ### Splash screen\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hy-zc4OR2.gif)\n\n* ### Auction\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HklGc4_Rn.gif)\n\n* ### Proposals\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BklzcVO0n.gif)\n\n* ### Wallet\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1Jf5EuC2.gif)",

In the category of \"teams with mostly finished projects\", I'm looking at Agora, Nouns Builder, and (to a lesser extent) Nounish as comparable examples, ranging 200 ETH - 1K ETH. For individual projects that are more experimental, I'm looking at Voter.wtf, Mogu, and others in the 10 - 15 ETH range.\n\nI took a look at the Github repo, though I am by no means a Swift developer. It seemed that the project was still in an early state, the majority of the code was written a little over two weeks ago, and it was primarily driven by a solo developer. This would fit the same pattern as Voter.wtf and Mogu.\n\nVoter.wtf and Mogu were both made by solo developers, but at the time of their prop they were already working and their ask was 1/5th of the size. I would consider a proposal that was more in line with the precedent set by Voter.wtf/Mogu, of a smaller size and with greater readiness (such as a Testflight link and written documentation). As much as I appreciate the project's goals, I don't view it as ready for the requested funding amount compared to precedent.\n\n*sent from voter.wtf*",

Since launching [with 69 ETH](https://nouns.wtf/vote/51) over 16 months ago, we've evolved into a dynamic, Nounish DAO, empowering action sportspeople through communal funding, collective creation and shared proceeds.\n\nWe're primed to deploy the GNARS playbook (as depicted above) and integrate Nouns intimately into our subcultures, leveraging our Goodwill, Network, Advocacy, Releases, and Serendipity (hypercycle).\n\n📝 *Skateboarding is frequently our illustrative example. However, our commitment to genuine engagement spans all subcultures we're a part of.*\n\n---\n\n## 📌 TLDR\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeig367dwt7otkzo2soyip5tkhdggifnk3paz3timpll3jxtsuw7bae)\n\n**Requesting 200 ETH...**\n\n- Transition Gnars from Mainnet to Zora Network\n- Secure operational funds for our core contributors\n- Allocate a treasury for continuous park enhancements\n- Introduce intuitive onboarding with QR/NFC plaques\n- Enhance Nouns' outreach with subculture expertise\n\n...to bring a million shredders onchain!\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 DYOR\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeihpe47c44p3cwggtfeq7bgnjo4oj3glubrcvxgdv4vghtrqlihwdy)\n\n**Gnars at a glance...**\n\n- Browse both our [offchain](https://snapshot.org/#/gnars.eth) (90) and [onchain](https://www.gnars.wtf/dao) (9) proposals\n- Curate [That's Gnarly](https://thatsgnar.ly/) (337 creators) collectibles ($15.6k raised)\n- View our pioneering first ever DAO released [skate video part](https://zora.co/collect/eth:0x96c752ed99a77702bdf58e03f9dd9e654236e2f3/1)\n- [Tom's Tuts](https://www.instagram.com/tom_rohrer) on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtegw6Eml5c&t=36s), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/toms_tutorials/) and [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@toms.tutorials) (10M+ views)\n- Enjoy films by Nounish like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgeEwp4uizw), [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQSmfSnRGVk), or [this one](https://twitter.com/nounish/status/1683444320433590272) \n- Survey our [Prop House](https://prop.house/gnars) and winners like [this epic event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3unXaYpMl8)\n- Bid in our [ongoing auctions](https://www.gnars.wtf/) ahead of [The Gnarving](https://www.gnars.wtf/#gnarving)\n- [Toggle the switch](https://www.gnars.wtf/) to see each Gnar's HD version\n\n...to do your own research.\n\n---\n\n## 🛹 Background/Problem Statement\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeiam6uer545pvjsbzbtnw5uy77mr3t3wus7iazve42yv4h7ezvsjeu)\n\n📝 *Cult classic > Corporate cringe. Movements > Marketing.*\n\nSkateboarding and similar subcultures, despite their rise in popularity, grapple with commercial overreach and value retention. Some of the most pressing challenges include:\n\n1. **Commercial Exploitation**: Outside brands jumping into skateboarding often prioritise profit over authenticity.\n2. **Loss of Authenticity**: Many skaters, due to financial pressures, might promote brands they don't genuinely align with.\n3. **Skater Exploitation**: Many skaters, despite their talent, don't receive fair compensation, especially considering the sport's physical demands.\n4. **Mainstream Misrepresentation**: Media portrayals frequently miss the genuine essence of skateboarding, leaning into stereotypes.\n5. **Skatepark Commercialisation**: Once-communal skateparks are becoming increasingly commercialised.\n6. **Core Values vs. Growth**: Balancing foundational skateboarding values with growth opportunities remains a delicate act.\n\nThe skateboarding domain needs a thoughtful equilibrium. Brands that genuinely get and respect the skate culture have the potential to collaboratively benefit both parties without diluting the sport's spirit.\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Proposed Solution\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreiflj5bgctvmzjujul3kvehilbgrzcag7zhomomfdtrtbit4sptjym)\n\n📝 *Check out the [Meier Skatepark renovation](https://www.gnars.wtf/dao/proposals/3) proposal that's currently being delivered*\n\nEmpowering individuals to step into the blockchain world is central to our mission. Shredders, akin to artists, can undergo transformative experiences through this. Our overarching goal is to amplify our influence, simplify operational processes, and champion those with genuine grassroots credibility.\n\n**GNARS** as an acronym crystallizes our ethos, mirroring the Nouns' virtuous cycle, acting as our serendipity machine:\n\n- **Goodwill**: Renewing skateparks and introducing new, shred-worthy sculptures\n- **Network**: Culturally sensitive contributions earn us both visibility and respect\n- **Advocacy**: Harmonising with communities helps us draw in new enthusiasts\n- **Releases**: Collective creative outputs with shared proceeds bolster funding\n- **Serendipity**: Getting onchain empowers shredders, opening fresh avenues\n\n---\n\n## 🌟 Opportunity\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreihhjrjim3rtjd6k2drh6r5gpy5i7xfp22gjcuouujecd2p4arkxhq)\n\nOur target of onboarding a million shredders might seem lofty, but it's just a fraction - 0.2% - of the 490 million participants in extreme sports.\n\nTo provide some perspective, skateboarding alone boasts 85 million participants. Industries like adventure tourism further validate our optimistic projections, given their sustained growth trajectories.\n\n---\n\n## 🧭 Approach and Strategy\n\n[![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeifkzcdwnvktxhmf47i67iel4gqyqtqc6jkhqc2xfxxqnfnmjr5dja)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3unXaYpMl8)\n\n📝 *Watch this NounGnarversary celebration funded via Prop House [on YouTube ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3unXaYpMl8)*\n\nGnars takes pride in our unique, community-focused contributions to skate culture. Here's how we plan to maximize our impact:\n\n- **Local Council Engagement**: Propose collaborations with councils, emphasising mutual benefits. Secure permissions for QR/NFC plaques.\n- **Community Consultation**: Prioritise feedback, ensuring final outputs align with community needs and aspirations.\n- **Skateable Art**: Commission designs that are both visually appealing and skateable, enhancing park functionality.\n- **Skate Community Collaborations**: Organise events to spotlight our mission. Rope in local influencers as ambassadors.\n- **Educational Initiatives**: Engage with schools and clubs, emphasising the interplay of art, skateboarding, and community projects.\n- **Media Outreach**: Use local media to showcase project completions and events, underscoring our tech integrations.\n- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Use digital tools to gauge user engagement and gather feedback, refining future strategies.\n\nOur dual focus on the skateboarding community and local councils ensures that our initiatives resonate with authentic cultural value.\n\n---\n\n## 📊 Budget Breakdown\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeihebdyhnukubmcxl3tkhlqrn3dzwx5ace6uck2l2cd6ggb6tdq72i)\n\nPer the TLDR, our ask is 200 ETH to our treausury (DAO executor) at `gnars.eth`, outlined as:\n\n- **Continuous park enhancements - 150 ETH**\n    - Skate and other terrain park refurbishments globally\n    - Shred-worthy Nouns themed sculpture fabrications\n    - Installs of commemorative QR/NFC enabled plaques\n    - Unveiling and onboarding events fully documented\n    - Releases of all works onchain as paid or free mints\n    - All mint proceeds split with creators and treasury\n    - Being enabled by Nouns is core to Gnars' story\n- **Administration of GNARS strategy - 42 ETH**\n    - Coordinate community-driven promotional activities\n    - Manage various Gnars Media House curatorial efforts\n    - Oversee day to day operations and general administration\n    - Experiment with retro rewards (up to 2 ETH/month/contributor)\n    - Community discord moderation and shredder onboarding\n    - Collaborate with Rainbow wallet on QR / NFC activations\n    - Disburse free Gnars (10%) from multisig for shredders\n    - Provide assistance to our pods and working groups\n- **Migrate Gnars to Zora Network - 8 ETH**\n    - Add a timelock period/minimum quorum before new DAO opens up for props so nobody captures the first few props\n    - Deploy all contracts to Zora\n    - Edit frontend to integrate with Zora\n    - Migrate subgraph\n    - Implement gnars claiming process\n    - Plan for treasury migration\n    - Complete full migration\n\n📝 *Through onchain governance we will allocate funds as earmarked and will be experimenting with Partitions for a holistic approach to treasury management. If you've any questions about the finer details, please don't hesitate to [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/gnars) for a discussion.

Your continued encouragement, feedback, and trust are what make such endeavors possible. By embracing our proposal, you're not just endorsing a project, but championing the blend of art, culture, and authenticity that both Nouns and Gnars represent.\n\n![](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeif2wakdatsq7urcefu2r7oo57vpmuobfheqk5u45dky5eo2whw2va)\n\nIn gratitude for your time and consideration, and as a gesture of our appreciation, we've created a unique, commemorative NFT to mark the submission of this proposal. For the month of Shredtember, we invite you to [mint this FREE NFT](https://gna.rs/hypercycle) and all Zora Protocol Rewards will be split between Nouns and Gnars treasuries. A special thank you for being an intrinsic part of our journey.\n\nYour voice matters. As we conclude, we earnestly encourage each member of the Nouns community to cast their vote with comment. Together, let's continue to reshape, reimagine, and literally Shred the Nouns.\n\nThank you for considering a future where passion, play, and purpose collide!\n\nBe sure to [scroll our Twitter](https://twitter.com/gnars_dao) for all the latest happenings.\n\nSHRΞD M❍RE\n\n⌐◨🤘◨",

When requested in larger sums, it can have material $ impact operationally (for e.g. ETH dropping 100$ a matter of days and a request for 200ETH is a 20k delta. I am assuming Gnars is aware of that risk and funding any differential out of pocket. I really wish this was requested in USDC instead of vague lump-sum ETH denominated ask. \n\n- Assuming Nouns is funding the OpEx mentioned here, what is the timeline behind it? Is it done over course of a month, 6 months, a year? Not having clarity on that front makes it unclear what the run-rate really is for the subDAO.\n\nMany Nouners will likely not backchannel asking for details like that if its missing in the proposal and its good practice to include it wherever possible. \nNot opposed to funding Gnars, but I will be no on this specific one for my above mentioned reasons. \n\nI understand this will pass anyways, but something to consider for future Gnars proposals.

      "description": "# Prop House IRL Experience 💡\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/coC4yHP.gif)\n\n[Prop House](https://prop.house) is an excellent entry point for builders in the Nouns ecosystem. The Nouns in Rio team is requesting **9 ETH + 9,500 USDC** to create an engaging Prop House Experience in a hub brimming with innovators.\n‎ \n## How 👀\n\nWe plan to create a round in the upcoming Nouns in Rio House and open exclusively* to all [Blockchain Rio](https://blockchainfestival.io/) attendees, a place full of builders aspiring to build for the Web3 ecosystem and push the boundaries of innovation.\n\nA pool of 7 ETH will be designated to back 20 projects, each set to receive 0.35 ETH. Proposals must aim to enhance Prop House in some way, whether through community integration, explainer videos, code development, and more. After the event, Nouners will have a one-week voting window to determine which projects get funded.\n\n**During the event, we'll ask builders interested in submitting a proposal to fill out a form. This ensures that all proposals come from verified event participants.*\n‎ \n![](https://i.imgur.com/8kR9fgd.png)  \n‎ \n## Why 🤔\n\nWe want individuals to recognize Prop House as a platform where they can get funding to bring their ideas to life. By showcasing the diverse groups already benefiting from the platform, we aim to inspire them to consider how they can engage their own communities in similar ways.\n\nThe true value of this experience lies not only in funding individual projects but also in connecting talented builders to the Nouns DAO community. By cultivating this relationship, we create a pathway for ongoing collaboration and innovation, encouraging them to continue contributing to and growing with the community.\n\nCheck out all the amazing things that have come from Prop House. **Nouns has funded one of the best Web3 platforms, and it's high time we spread the word about it.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AZR3Lfp.png)\n‎ \n## Where 📍\n\nWe discovered Prop House at an event and from that moment we knew we wanted to create an IRL experience for it. Now, we have the perfect chance. We'll be at the largest Web3 & Business event in Latin America, [Blockchain Rio](https://blockchainfestival.io/), from September 12th to 14th, alongside big names like Polkadot, CoinEx, Polygon, Ledger, and more. It's the ideal place to find passionate builders and introduce them to Prop House.\n\nTake a look at the first edition of the event from 2022, which attracted more than 22,000 visitors, featured 432 speakers, and generated 86 million reais in economic impact for the state of Rio de Janeiro.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/CODwQjS.gif)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/l3gsmny.png)\n\n*Brazilian builders on stage talking about Nouns and Prop House. [Watch here!](https://twitter.com/blockchain_rio/status/1630946236105736195)* \n‎ \n## Lounge 🛋️\n\nOur lounge will include two interactive totems that enable attendees to explore Prop House and toggle between different houses and rounds. Additionally, two large TVs will display a video produced by us, highlighting projects funded by various communities through Prop House. The lounge backdrop will offer step-by-step instructions, complete with a QR code, for submitting proposals.\n\nAll of this will support the team in explaining what Prop House is and how it works. We'll also **give a talk** at the event and invite people to join the experience and submit their projects.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ut98dfj.png)\n\n*The layout of the lounge and the art on the backdrop are for illustrative purposes and may not represent the final design.*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UNfxWZG.png)\n‎ \n## Team 🤝\n\n[Nouns in Rio](https://twitter.com/NounsInRio) team, represented by [JP](https://twitter.com/home) and [Debinvest](https://twitter.com/debinvest), is behind the project. They will be on-site at the lounge to explain Prop House, discuss the round, and assist with wallet creations and proposal submissions.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9mp1CbE.png)\n\nNouns in Rio team has successfully organized various nounish IRL events, including [Nouns Week](https://nounsweek.wtf/rio-de-janeiro/), the [Treasure Hunt](https://twitter.com/NounsInRio/status/1574418495911219201), [social actions](https://twitter.com/NounsInRio/status/1606765831064588288) for Prop House's Nounish Holidays and many others.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/WDTRnam.png)\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/uFXRkNX.gif)\n\n*Nouns Week*\n‎ \n## Budget 💰\n\nWith 7 ETH, we can fund a diverse range of projects with a meaningful ETH value. JP and Debinvest will each receive 1 ETH for managing the project and staffing the lounge during the event. The cost for setting up and operating the event space, which includes event fees and production expenses, will be 9,500 USDC. In case fewer than 20 proposals are submitted, **all remaining ETH will be returned to the DAO.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HqGnVgI.png)\n‎ \n## Success ✨\n\nAfter the event concludes, we'll provide the DAO with both an aftermovie and a detailed report. This report will feature key metrics like site visits during the event (provided by the Prop House team if possible), submitted proposals, QR code scans, and minted POAPs. We'll also extend an invitation to all funded project leads to join the [Nouns in Rio Discord server](https://discord.gg/yBFRt2D894) for ongoing project follow-up, ensuring sustained engagement and support.\n\nTo amplify our impact, we'll actively engage the community through our Portuguese Nounish channels like [@nounsinrio](instagram.com/nounsinrio), [@nounsbr](instagram.com/nounsbr) and [@thenounsquarebr](https://www.tiktok.com/@thenounsquarebr). The engagement metrics from these channels will be included in our final report.\n\nWe recognize this is a pivotal time for the DAO, but due to the time-sensitive nature of our project, we felt the need to proceed. Thank you for reading and considering this proposal. Let's take Prop House to the streets! 💡\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dAMtste.gif)",

Soon with the prop house protocol it will be the case that anyone can create create PH houses/rounds and even create their own sites that interact with those houses/rounds specifically. One of the limitations of the current PH site is that it creates a very nested UI and treats most rounds with a similar UX. There's a big design space for making PH rounds hyper local to a given context (hackathon, grants giving, etc; rio, seoul, etc). Would love to see more experimentation in this direction and applaud the Nouns in Rio team in putting a prop forward   here. ",

If you’re new to CC0, it’s a \"no copyright reserved\" option in which all copyright is relinquished and dedicated to the public domain. This enables use of CC0 NFTs with zero legal repercussions, inspiring creative derivatives and remixes of original works. \n\nCC0 may be everywhere, but here’s a lesser-known fact: Creative Commons is also a whole nonprofit organization (see our most recent annual report [here](https://creativecommons.org/2023/04/11/state-of-the-commons-2022/)). \n\nWe’ve been around since 2001 and are a small but mighty team of 22 open access enthusiasts. We not only manage the CC licenses and public domain tools, we run campaigns, programming, and training in Open Education, Culture, Climate, and Journalism; host a CC Global Summit in locations around the world; and tackle major policy issues impacting the Internet and global commons as part of a broad Movement for a Better Internet. \n\nWe’re doing a lot, but it is all in service of the CC licenses, a thriving commons, and a healthy public domain, which can be expanded instantly by contemporary creators embracing the use of CC0, a globally interoperable public domain dedication tool. Like Nouns, we’re big promoters of remix culture, and have been watching (_largely from the sidelines until now!_) as NFT creators bring new energy and enthusiasm to the public domain.  \n\nWe’re excited to bring our two communities together to demonstrate the staying power of open access tools like CC0 even in a technological landscape that’s rapidly changing. Nouns is a prime example of this. You’re an open-source brand merging CC0 with blockchain. Nouns demonstrates the imaginative possibilities of combining public interest tools like CC Licenses with emergent technologies. \n\n# Request\n\nDespite being components of longstanding and emerging technologies, CC licenses are hard to fundraise for–most people are unaware that there’s no underlying revenue stream to maintain their legal and tech infrastructure and continue to advocate for their use. The licenses are not new tech anymore, despite constantly being used in fresh ways, and it’s challenging when most funders are more interested in flashy new projects than supporting the work those ventures build on. \n\nWe are dedicated to preserving and improving our licenses, so that they can continue to be the go-to tool for future technology and creative work. That’s why CC is seeking funding for our general operations and license infrastructure, which would allow us to sustain currently underfunded but foundational areas of work: advocating for the use and adoption of open content at all levels and in all arenas, stewarding and innovating the licensing infrastructure we provide, and training future generations of creators and open advocates. \n\nWith support from Nouns, Creative Commons can prioritize the stewardship of the tools that have unlocked access to an estimated 2 billion works over the past 20 years. We are hoping your community will support us, as our work has supported your creativity.\n\n# Proposed Transactions\n\nDue to challenges that arise when Endaoment smart contracts are paired with Nouns proposal duration, this revised version of Prop 329 sends 100 ETH directly to Creative Commons' hosted wallet: \n\n0xf28ed835261b005C490D9d3D9eaADC54d9737d87",

This has the potential to greatly increase the amount of creative content that is available to everyone, and it is something that I strongly support.\n\nCreative Commons is a small but important organization that does a lot of great work to promote open access.

It's almost sad when we are hold the potential of being the proud stewards of the almost equally illiquid Ether Rock.  By voting yes to the Punk and Ether Rock we can ensure that Nouns' treasury is not only invested with superior illiquidity, but also irreversibly lock away our DAO's value forever. It's a foolproof investment strategy.\n\nLet's show the world how truly experimental we are. Embrace the Punk, embrace the Ether Rock! It's not just an investment; it's a lifestyle, a statement, a monument to our collective wisdom.\n\n![something](https://i.ibb.co/BNYMqdB/image.png)\n\n*Please ignore the funds being sent to my wallet.

      "description": "# Establish Nouns FGC (Fighting Game Community) at EVO 2023\n\n![EVO Noggles](https://i.imgur.com/sCSnrda.png)\n\n\nProject Lead: [Keolaization](https://twitter.com/keolaization)\nSupported by The [Nouns Esports](https://twitter.com/nounsesports) Pod\n\n\n## Video Rundown - [Nouns Esports Audiovisual Proposal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rspS-OZAmw)\n\n## TLDR:\n\n*EVO is one of the world's biggest and most well-known fighting game tournaments. Yearly players from every corner of the globe come out to not only compete, but to fraternize and create memories that will last a lifetime.*\n\n*With the scale and magnitude of EVO within the fighting game community, this would be a perfect opportunity for Nouns Esports to expand from Smash into the larger fighting game esports sphere.*\n\n*Our objective this year is for Nouns to make a splash in the fighting game esports scene by sponsoring a large group of fighting game players at the largest fighting game tournament in the world! With the new Street Fighter title, this is the year to be at EVO and there would be many opportunities for the Nouns Esports brand to catch viewer and participant attention.*\n\n*Nouns Esports requests 36,000 USDC to sponsor a variety of fighting game players from around the world to attend EVO, the world’s largest fighting game tournament, taking place from Aug 4th to the 6th in 2023.*\n\n![EVO Tournament Pic](https://i.imgur.com/Xs9lUCU.jpg)\n\n\n## Description\n\n\n\nThis proposal expands our esports reach into the world of fighting games. \n\nSelection will be handled through [Prop House](https://prop.house/nouns-esports/) with Nouns Esports members providing outreach directly to fighting game community encouraging players to apply on the site.\n\n\n**Our plan:** \n- Around 30－40 Competitors at EVO\n    - All representing Nouns\n        - Noggles for all players + shirts\n- Noggles for all players\n- Nouns Esports shirts with a mock up visual for all players\n- Planned Nouns team-building/social event during EVO \n    - Idea: Pizza Party (potential PizzaDAO collab)\n- Planned media coverage (photos/video) - \n    - Questions like: \"What does Evo mean to you? Nouns?\"\n- start.gg affiliation (putting the Nouns custom tag when registering on start.gg for a tournament in the format of [Nouns | Keolaization]) \n\n**Funding Plan:**\n\n- 36,000 USDC ask \n- Unused funds will be returned\n    - Player Funding Cost (~75%)\n        - For each player the standard funding we will be providing to sponsor their travel and lodging is 300 USDC for North America and 800 USDC for international players\n    - Pizza Party/Social Event Funding Cost (~10%)\n            - Food: Pizza\n            - Drinks: Sodas/Water\n            - Venue: Either rent out a restauraunt/suite/conference space\n            - Other potential items: Plates, utensils, napkins, cups\n        - Possibility to run social event though PizzaDAO\n    - Operational Management and Support (~15%)\n        - Contributor pay\n        - Cost of travel for organizers to oversee the event\n        - Miscellaneous costs\n\n## **Why EVO?**\n\nLast year there were over 7,000 players participating from 63 different countries, with nearly 18,000 players in attendace at the venue, and over 3.7 million people who tuned in to the live stream for the event. This year, as COVID-19 restrictions loosen in many places around the world and things return to normal, it is guaranteed to grow even bigger. Especially with the prize pool minimum for main games being increased to $25,000, there will undoubtedly be more participants coming out to try prove their worth.\n\nMany select top players at this event are sponsored by various different companies and esports organizations, but there are many more who are either not sponsored despite their high levels of play or are sponsored but are not able to make it to Evo due to financial reasons such as lack of support from their team. This is where Nouns Esports can come into the picture.\n\nThrough players applying through Prophouse, we can sponsor select players based off of their skill as well as their needs to give them the chance to have the best possible experience at Evo. Whether it be a full ride for an extremely high level player or just a small boost to their funds, providing to the needs of the player will not only allow Nouns Esports to show their goodwill to the community, but can also spread the Nouns Esports brand and the Nouns brand to a potentially new community. Not only that, but if we can successfully sponsor the most players, it would be a huge PR win for the organization.\n\n\n\n## Who We Are\n\nNouns Esports was established in [Proposal 68](https://nouns.wtf/vote/68). We have since continued Nouns proliferation through esports as seen in [Proposal 91](https://nouns.wtf/vote/91), [Proposal 112](https://nouns.wtf/vote/112), [Proposal 119](https://nouns.wtf/vote/119).\n\nDota 2 & CS:GO\nPokemon Unite\nTaki & Aklo\n\n[nouns.gg](https://nouns.gg)\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/nounsesports)\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/nounsesports)\n\n\n\n\n## **Multisig**\n\nWe will be using the same multisig that was created for [Proposal 263](https://nouns.wtf/vote/263) consisting of Nouners and Nounsfolk. \n\n- Sasquatch\n- Brennen\n- Maty\n- Oni\n- Peter\n\n![Nouns Esports Logo](https://i.imgur.com/rPHF40P.jpg)\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAll in all, we are looking to make a splash in the larger fighting game esports scene by setting the right foot forward and trying to make history. We really believe that we can gain traction and show our Nounish values to the larger community to create a long lasting relationship that will benefit both sides.\n\n### **Thank you for reading!**\n\n\n",

      "description": "# A Nouns Animated Series.\n\n\n**TL;DR**:\n\nWe are requesting $95,000 USDC for the creation of the **first episode** in a, 13-episode, animated series, featuring Nouns. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/P6anXPg.jpg)\n\n---\n# The Series:\n\n\n\n**We are proposing to create the first full-fledged animated series for Nouns.**\n\nThis will be a fun and thrilling series that will take us to a fantastic setting within a school, where we follow the adventures of five friends.\n\nEvery day, after the bell rings and classes end, a magical world reveals itself to these young friends. Each episode takes us on a new challenge or puzzle to be solved by the protagonists. They embark on magical missions, explore galaxies, secret rooms, and discover hidden passages that lead to incredible worlds within the school. The school environment transforms into a place full of surprises, with magic, creatures, and fantastic moments.\n\nWhile facing exciting challenges, the protagonists also learn important lessons about friendship, courage, and teamwork. They discover that true power lies in unity and trust in one another.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/V7CflxQ.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jf2PpS1.png)\n\nThe **primary target audience will be children aged 7-11**. Our main goal is to inspire them through relatable characters, engaging stories, and meaningful dialogue that resonates with their own aspirations for the future. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UbWKeiv.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bXF0WBs.png)\n\nThe show will maintain a family-friendly atmosphere, exploring various themes like friendship, adventures, and romance. We also aim to **subtly introduce educational elements**, including more advanced concepts such as web3, blockchains, and DAOs, providing young viewers with an introduction to these complex topics.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AZUWCpG.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MBIaOKr.png)\n\n\n[Here you can find a complete breakdown of these first 5 characters, as well as initial plot concepts and script.](https://interesting-taker-974.notion.site/A-Nouns-Series-by-Breakout-10eafd6961da448083b45df3fea6c9fa)\n\n---\n# References:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Wd6LA3e.png)\n\n---\n# **Jux Animation Studio:**\n\n[Jux ](https://www.juxfilmes.com.br/)is an established animation studio and will be the company responsible for the production of the series. With a strong track record in the animation industry, the company has worked for many well known clients and brings a wealth of experience and expertise to the project.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/C2yPsUy.png)\n\nJux has a vast network of professionals from around the world, including illustrators, animators, writers, and sound producers, who will also contribute to the series.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NqRaQtY.gif)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KyEEXby.png)\n\nJux also produced the short film \"Through the Looking Noggle!\" as an entry to the Nouns video contest. The video recieved an overwhelmingly positive response, and was chosen as one of the four winning entries.\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/sghZnjI.gif)\n\n[Website and Full Reel](https://www.juxfilmes.com.br/) \n\n\n---\n# Core Team:\n\n#### **Marcello Laruccia (Animation Director)** - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcello-laruccia-84b09b23)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/lJ0ujhf.gif)\n\n[Full Reel](https://www.dropbox.com/s/53qdlfgy24x6z68/MLaruccia_reel_2023.mov?dl=0)\n#### **Victor Canela (Lead Writer)** - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victorgaz/)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BbdCk21.png)\n\n#### **Bruno Tedesco (Animation Supervisor)** - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-tedesco-b9829538/)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zfALXei.gif)\n\n[Full Reel](https://vimeo.com/457995567)\n#### **Patrick Dias (Creative Lead)** - [Portfolio](https://patrickdias.work/about-me)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CDSEXoE.png)\n---\n\n**Alongside the team above, many other talented professionals will be involved in the production of this pilot including:**\n\n[JukeBox](https://www.juke.art.br/) (Audio Production)\n[Daniela Zschaber](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniela-zschaber/) (Writer)\n[Aurelio Ribeiro/TheBower](https://twitter.com/thebower_) (Exec. Producer)\n[Daniel Ferrari ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/d2-ferrari-a90b822b/)(Producer)\n\nAs well as supporting **illustrators, animators and editors**.\n\n---\n# Production Timeline:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/U7CxXj4.png)\nAbove you can find a **detailed view of each step in the production process.**\n\nDelivery of the first episode will be within **4 months** of this proposal acceptance. \nThroughout the production we will be posting **regular updates on a dedicated Telegram channel**, including teasers and details of the process.\n\n\nAfter delivering the pilot we will submit a proposal to produce the subsequent 4 episodes. All episodes after this first one will have a smaller, 1.5-month, production period each due to a lot of the ground work being done already, such as character and background development.\n\n\n# Distribution:\n\n#### - Youtube\nOur initial strategy will be to upload the series directly to a dedicated Youtube channel. **Content for kids on Youtube performs extremely well** and garners massive views. Our intent is to capture that audience and generate a significant viewership with a dedicated fanbase.\n\n#### - Droposal\nMuch like similar content released by Nouns, we will also seek to mint this first episode via a droposal.\n\n**However, we propose a novel distribution with 100% of the funds going back to the DAO.** The idea is to do a community poll with Nouners to decide the mint price.\nBased on the success of this first episode and mint sales we could see a significant revenue returning back to the DAO.\n# Road To Success:\n\nAfter the delivery of the pilot our intent is not only to produce the remaining episodes but to build the project into something even bigger. Here are some of the strategies we are planning:\n\n*(The following ideas are for the future of the project and not included in this proposal)*\n\n- Distribution Deal: Pursue partnerships through our industry contacts with TV channels and streaming providers - We believe the series would have a strong appeal to these companies as not only having a popular target audience of young teens but also by addressing new and innovative topics like blockchain and web3. \n- Merchandising and Toys: Partner with established companies to produce Merch and Toys featuring the characters in the series bringing another revenue stream for the series and the DAO.\n\n---\n\n# Budget Breakdown:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bG8tmAl.png)\n\n([Google sheet with complete budget breakdown](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1arqB7sFMJ9HpEraUbgLuhSR9cDxoOKv-pNQfC_2XP1I/edit?usp=sharing))\n\n\n**Total Ask: USDC $95.000** (~48 ETH at current prices)\n\n\n**This budget reflects the production of a high-quality, 6-minute animated pilot**, which also serves as the foundation for the series - this includes character design and personality, environment, plot, among other essential work.\n\n---\n## From The Team\n\n**Our objective is to create an amazing series that is unique and truly nounish.**\n\nWith this pilot we hope to showcase the concept and viability of this series, as well as lay a strong foundation on which we can build upon.\n\nOur team is passionate and commited to this project, many of us are strongly connected to the Nouns ecosystem and have a deep interest in its collective success.\n\nThank you!\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "Nouns Wallet - $3M to $5M a year in revenue for Nouns DAO",
      "description": "# Nouns Wallet - $3M to $5M a year in revenue for Nouns DAO\n\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n**1-minute explainer video:**\n[![Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/uhbaVoQMKDU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhbaVoQMKDU)\n\n**How can it benefit Nouns DAO?:** 90% of the revenue generated by the product goes straight to Nouns DAO. Estimated to be $3-5M a year. Basis of the estimate is explained in detail in the proposal below.\n\n**Main value proposition to users of this product:** Increases users' asset allocation to hot wallets, thus helping users access DeFi and the metaverse in an agile, secure and comfortable manner, reducing time costs and transaction costs involved regularly refilling hot wallet accounts. Not a single hot wallet product exists in B2C form that gives users access to fully flexible threshold signing schemes. Nouns Wallet will be the first to introduce this idea, and in a fully transparent manner.\n\n**Ask:** \n25 ETH round 1\n\n25 ETH round 2\n\n**Detailed Proposal:**\n\nThe B2C hot wallet market has been under the firm grip of MetaMask, riding high on its first-mover advantage. However, this dominance has left customers vulnerable to unfair policies and practices imposed by MetaMask. First, they sneaked away from open-source code to closed-source. And now, brace yourself, their updated privacy policies grant them the power to track user IP addresses and more! Sure, they claim not to keep this data for more than 7 days or sell it, but can we really verify that? Who will be held accountable for any shenanigans? What are the loopholes in this web of secrecy? Plus, let's not forget, this opens up a single point of attack for snooping into customer data. The only way to escape this labyrinth is through complete transparency of code.\n\nBut wait, there's another gaping hole in the B2C hot wallet industry! It's the absence of fully flexible threshold signing schemes for users. Hot wallets are crucial for interacting with web3 applications and protocols. However, these hot wallets, like MetaMask, store the entire private key on the user's machine. It's like leaving the door wide open for attacks, as the key remains decrypted for the duration of wallet activity, in order to make digital signatures.\n\nNow, some wallets try to beef up security and tackle this single point of attack issue by offering 2-factor authentication (2FA) or even 3-factor authentication (3FA). But guess what? These traditional forms of 2FA or 3FA rely on third-party applications that specialize in 2FA, like Authy, Duo Mobile, or Google Authenticator, and/or depend on third-party entities, such as 2FA from Google Cloud or email codes. This introduces the dreaded risk of a centralized point of failure! It forces users to always have access to these third parties and assumes they will function flawlessly. Some wallets even offer 2FA through their own mobile apps or via SMS codes, but alas, this makes users susceptible to SIM swap attacks. And let me tell you, SIM swap attacks have wreaked havoc on crypto holders in the past. Countless articles on the internet can attest to that.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, some wallets have attempted MultiSig, where one signature is required from the user's key and another from the company's key. But let me tell you, this setup is not only inefficient and inflexible, but also lacks ironclad security. Inflexible because any changes to the keys, adding or removing them, require rewriting the code. It's like making it set in stone when it comes to signing policies (2 of 2 or 2 of 3 being the most common) and the keys generated and used. Moreover, MultiSig demands exorbitant transaction fees due to the need for higher block space or, in simpler terms, multiple signatures required to sign the transaction on the chain.\n\nBut behold! We have the ultimate solution to tackle all of the above conundrums: Fully Open-Sourced Threshold Signing! Sounds cool, right? It's time to revolutionize the game and bring back the fun, security, and flexibility that users truly deserve!\n\n1-minute explainer video: [![Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/uhbaVoQMKDU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhbaVoQMKDU)\n\n\n![Image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1FgrRd7k2ckTGqV1ByW1LyC5FbqBg3fBX)\n\n\n\nAdditionally, being fully open sourced makes us verifiably user-friendly in terms of privacy policies and security.\n\n**Estimated Revenue to the Nouns treasury from this project**\n\nLet's dive into the exciting realm of revenue figures! If we cast our eyes upon [this chart](https://dune.com/queries/19721/40444), MetaMask has been raking in around $200,000 per day in fees over the past few months. That's a whopping $70 million per year, give or take! For more in-depth insights, you can check out the [comprehensive dashboard](https://dune.com/tomhschmidt/metamask-swap) and enlightening [article](https://thedefiant.io/metamask-raking-in-170k-day-shows-defi-wallets-work-as-businesses) on MetaMask's daily and cumulative swap fee revenue.\n\nNow, let's shift our focus to Exodus, a prominent player in the hot wallet scene. In the last two Q3s, their quarterly revenues reached a commendable $18 million and $11 million, respectively. If you're hungry for details, head over to [this page](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/11/09/2552383/0/en/Exodus-Report-Third-Quarter-2022-Results.html) and feast your eyes on the specifics.\n\nBut here's the exciting part: We aim to compete head-on with MetaMask and other hot wallets by offering a threshold MPC system ingeniously integrated into browser extension and web app hot wallets. With all the potential this project holds, we conservatively estimate that it could eventually churn out a remarkable $3 million to $5 million per year in swap fees alone. And who knows, it might even soar to the astounding heights of $70 million, just like MetaMask!\n\nWhen it comes to revenue distribution, we've got a plan. For the first three years, the revenue will be divided into a 90-10 split between the Nouns Treasury and the devoted development team. This approach ensures resources are allocated for continuous product enhancements and growth. However, after the three-year mark, the Nouns DAO holds the power to either renew this revenue split or gracefully take 100% of the revenue for themselves.\n\n**Funding Ask and Deliverables**\n[Figma Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/6YX5xeU16rpvhybQm8OMhR/Nouns-Wallet?node-id=1-2&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2)\n\n![Image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1WKE6IrnbiDURXj5DwTGbfmVKP7GeG5QM)\n\n**25 ETH Round 1** – With a solid infusion of 25 ETH, we will kickstart the development of a basic yet functional Threshold Signing wallet. Within a swift timeline of just 2 months from the funding date, our talented team will focus their expertise on cryptography and backend wizardry. The frontend will have a simple, user-friendly interface adorned with a logo inspired by the captivating Nouns theme. To proudly showcase our collaboration, the wallet interface will prominently display \"Powered by NounsDAO.\" During this initial phase, we will demo the threshold signing capability exclusively on laptops. But fret not, as we have big plans for Round 2!\n\n\n**25 ETH Round 2** – Round 2, brace yourselves for greatness! With another 25 ETH in hand, we will elevate the UI/UX design aimed to maximize user experience and simplicity, ensuring that our wallet becomes an intuitive and seamless companion for crypto enthusiasts. As we fine-tune every detail, the wallet will be prepared for its grand launch. The timeline for this monumental event will be thoughtfully and collaboratively decided between our passionate team and the vibrant Nouns community.\n\n**Team**\nThe team building this are specialists in advanced cryptography and are also currently building a trustless bridge between non EVM chains.\nTo find out more about the team go to:\n[insaanity.io](https://insaanity.io)\n\n**Feedback from the Nouns community taken into consideration**\n\nWe express our heartfelt gratitude to the vibrant Nouns community on Discord and Discourse for their active participation and valuable feedback on our proposal. Your insights have been instrumental in shaping our approach, and we greatly appreciate your engagement.\n\nIn our previous communication, we had initially proposed a funding amount of 250 ETH for Round 2, with a significant portion of 200 ETH allocated towards code audits. This decision was primarily driven by our intention to utilize our proprietary threshold signing algorithm, which boasted certain advantages over the already audited threshold cryptography schemes available in the market. Notably, our algorithm showcased resilience against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, providing an added layer of security.\n\nHowever, we carefully considered the community's concerns regarding the substantial expenditure of 200 ETH solely on code audits. We wholeheartedly understand and respect the need for responsible resource allocation. Therefore, we have revised our approach and made the decision to leverage already existing standard audited libraries as our foundation, building upon their established security foundations. This strategic shift has significantly reduced our funding request to a modest 25 ETH.\n\nTo address any lingering apprehensions regarding DoS attacks, we have further fine-tuned our strategy. Out of B2B and/or B2C options, we will adopt the B2C (Business-to-Consumer) model, where the distribution of key shares will be limited to one's own devices and/or trusted family members' devices, rather than across unknown communities' devices. This approach ensures a more controlled and secure environment, where the threat of DoS attacks can be safely assumed to be absent.\n\nWe remain committed to our goal of delivering an exceptional threshold signing wallet, fortified by security best practices and community-driven input. Your feedback has been invaluable in shaping our path forward, and we are excited to continue this journey together, building a product that exceeds expectations.\n\nOnce again, we extend our sincere appreciation to the Nouns community for your unwavering support and collaboration. Let's embark on this exciting endeavor, shaping the future of hot wallets with utmost diligence and innovation!\n\n\n\n",

But more than that – a brand that reflects the culture.\n\nPublic Good’s goal is to bring the culture of cc0 and public good into the world of consumer products, putting Nouns in the spotlight as a leader in this movement.\n\nReal products amplify visibility and legitimize the ecosystem outside of crypto Twitter, facilitating the onboarding funnel and paving the way for the flywheel to work beyond speculation.\n\nWe are going global. And the first step has been taken.\n\n## First phase: done! ✅\n***\n💡 This first phase wasn’t funded by NounsDAO\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LrFagUj.png)\n\n✅ Public Good brand development\n✅ Prospecting partners\n✅ cc0 beer recipe creation\n✅ Label design and production\n✅ Canning of 3500 cans of Public Good IPA\n✅ Website creation ([access now](https://www.publicgood.wtf/))\n✅ Metaverse onboarding experience by Voidge ([access now](https://voidge.com/publicgood))\n✅ NFT airdrop for supporters and buyers\n✅ Lens handle airdrop for early supporters\n✅ Free technical consulting and upgrade of company e-commerce to accept cryptocurrencies\n✅ Launch Campaign with influencers funded by [Food Nouns](https://prop.house/foodnouns/open-kitchen-rounds/4282) (0.25 ETH) and [Cryptoadz](https://snapshot.org/#/cryptoadz.eth/proposal/0xfd727bbf5c5f8fec37b96ce7de6d8ce12dcd7aa12e4fa026b0bffbbc25860076) (0.25 ETH)\n✅ 2 main crypto events sponsorship in Brazil\n* BTC Pizza Day, Porto Alegre - 170 Attendees ([media](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pE7UDpaEauN8EECnBInMP-CVe4XFMgTg))\n* NFT Brazil, São Paulo - 20k Attendees ([watch video](https://twitter.com/PublicGoodBeer/status/1669666576985997312))   \n \nTwo months ago, Narcose was just another award-winning craft brewery. But now it is leading a global movement that it has pioneered. They accept crypto as a form of payment in their e-commerce, have tokenized experiences, have a metaverse, and see this new market as a point of differentiation. Now they are innovators AND BUILDERS, promoting the Nouniverse to all their stakeholders.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jZkSfr9.png)    \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HDOViNt.png)   \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rSak9r8.png)   \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DftqMcA.gif)   \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DxPb6M0.png)    \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2gdcu5z.png)   \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2EpTwZL.gif)   \n\nShout out to the amazing network of collaborators that believed in the cc0 culture, joined forces and made it all possible:\n\nfabioseva.eth (Coordination and Design), jp.⌐◨-◨ (Operations and Marketing), Narcose (Beer Production), Viking (Malt and Hop Supplier), [Buidler.it](http://buidler.it/) (NFT Launchpad), [Voidge.com](http://voidge.com/) (Metaverse Development), [BPague.com](http://bpague.com/) (Crypto Payment Gateway), BTC Pizza Day Porto Alegre (Event), NFT Brasil (Event), Foodnouns (Funding) Cryptoadz (Funding), Lens Protocol (Handles Giveaway)\n\n## An opportunity to scale 🌐\n***\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IJHYa1z.png)\nThe first phase proved that beer is an excellent product to start proliferation on a global scale. We are seeking funding to expand our actions in 3 complementary strategic directions:\n\n1. New regions 📍\n2. Proper marketing in Brazil 🇧🇷\n3. New product categories 👀   \n\n**1) New regions 📍**    \n![](https://i.imgur.com/4iKllzi.png)\nNarcose is already part of a network of regular collaborative breweries, through which it markets its beers in the US and Europe. We will take Public Good Beer to these markets, also integrating them into our onboarding ecosystem and turning them into real Nouns builders.\n\nWe are asking for 4500 USDC amount, enough for label printing, marketing material, initial sample distribution (est. 500 cans of beer), and post-production FOR EACH of our partners:\n\nStillwater Brewery (Seattle) 🇺🇸\nAgainst the Grain (Kentucky) 🇺🇸\nWooden Ship (Minneapolis) 🇺🇸\nBrewski (Sweden) 🇸🇪\nBierol (Austria) 🇦🇹\nCanil (Portugal) 🇵🇹\n\nNote that the goal is to catalyst a collaborative beer that will be sold as part of the brewery’s portfolio, not to distribute it only at a single event. The funding is an incentive to kickstart production and marketing and involves a commitment from the brewery.\n\n**BUDGET: 6x 4500 = 27000 USDC**   \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jvG8dTb.png)\n**2) Proper marketing in Brazil 🇧🇷**\n\nInternational expansion will not be instantaneous, as it demands a free schedule in the industry. In this period, we take advantage of the existing inventory of over 3000 cans produced.\n\nDespite the success of Phase 1, we believe we haven’t reached full IRL proliferation potential for such a pioneer project. We had 0.5 ETH for everything (sub 300 cans, and very short-scale marketing activation). Thus, the proposed expansion would bring the deserved impact and tons of resources for further promotion of the Nouniverse.\n\nThe next 2 biggest crypto weeks in Brazil happen in August (during NFTRio) and September (Blockchain Rio, which connected the Brazilian Nouns community IRL for the first time). We are asking 4500 USDC for each week to make a big impact at main and side events, including:\n\n* Public Good Beer distribution\n* Marketing materials (shirts, stickers, temporary tattoos)\n* Activations (POAP distribution, treasure hunts, giveaways)\n* Professional quality media production\n* We are asking for 4500 USDC for each week.\n\n**BUDGET: 2x 4500 = 9000 USDC**   \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DbzkhNr.gif)\n**3) New product categories 👀**\n\nBeyond beer, we have the opportunity to extend the portfolio to two synergic brands/categories:\n\na) BBQ sauces - for the weekly beer-fueled barbecues we do all around Brazil; and\nb) Sunscreen - for our 7637 km of coastline, full of bikinis, surf stars and sunglasses ⌐◨-◨\n\nWe would like to allocate a total budget of 5000 USDC to work this as the project progresses. Alongside with this we also have the coordination and maintenance of the activities during period of 6 months at a cost of 6000 USDC.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/p6Hr6hb.png)\n\n**BUDGET: 11000 USDC**   \n\n**TEAM**\n\nfabioseva.eth\njp.⌐◨-◨\n\nWe are very excited to keep spreading the CC0 culture and bringing companies on board with us. A huge shoutout and heartfelt thanks to everyone who’s supporting the project either online and IRL. Don’t forget to follow [@PublicGoodBeer](https://twitter.com/publicgoodbeer) on Twitter for all the latest updates. Cheers to a future of collaboration and doing good!\n\n**TOTAL ASK = 47000 USDC (~25 ETH)**   \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1VrFZjh.gif)   \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5zXWf6M.gif)   \n\n***\n_Sponsor's Note: (ccarella.eth)_    \nAs an enthusiast for Public Goods, I am thrilled to sponsor this proposal onchain. It's incredibly satisfying to witness a tangible representation of the Public Goods brand. With its CC0 recipe, distinctive branding, and collaboration with various breweries, this project stands out as an innovative venture that extends the reach of the meme. It also encourages people to contemplate the importance of both CC0 and Public Goods.",

I'm ok with the approach taken for partnership in the short term - ultimately the question is, can you make this scale? The design and recipes are CC0, can we generate enough demand to make using these obvious? Will the breweries continue brewing this and using the designs?\n\nFor this to be successful imho we need to see breweries making decent money from beer sales here. It should be so successful that current breweries keep brewing, and additional breweries jump in permissionlessly because it's a money making and marketing opportunity.\n\nIn future iterations I would like to see plans to try and get press coverage.",

The biggest ask here is marketing spend, and I'm not sure that feels the most high leverage? Again, seems team is doing well so I defer to them, but it seems like a sort of internet native, CC0 brand should leverage its organic and grassroots reach and try to stay cheap on the marketing spend. Would funding be better spent on hard fixed costs like production, shipping, storage, etc.? \n3. Related to 2., think about how you can best leverage your online fans! There's probably a LOT of people who could help get this into local spots around the world, can you find a way to empower your community? \n\nExcited to see what comes!\n\n*sent from voter.wtf*",

Narcose, for example, has produced 3000 cans of Public Good without any funding. The breweries in the proposal produce this or more per batch.\n\n4500 dollars will be used for label printing, events (probably more than one), a minimum of 500 free beers (our phase 1 was only 300), marketing, activations, and other production costs. There is no such thing as 9 dollars per can.\n\nOur costs are at the end of the proposal. \n\nThe team behind Phase 1 has unquestionable skills and experience to execute this proposal for Phase 2.

      "description": "# Nounify Korea - stamp collection campaign\n\n*Proposer note: I am happy be helping @fiveoceans_dev, @jheeart_nft, and @_duckhead get this onchain. I think this is a fun, sort of grassroots, small-is-big proliferation effort from a team that is highly committed to Nouns and has done quality work in the past.*\n \n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkFD93zdn.jpg)\n### TL;DR\n- We propose to launch a stamp-collecting campaign to nounify Korea.\n- Our primary objective is to establish Nouns as a prominent pop culture brand.\n- By collaborating with coffee shops and utilizing Nouns' CC0 content, we can maximize Nouns' exposure and provide incentives for fans.\n- To achieve this, we kindly request $65,000 or around $4,600 per location to promote nouns at 10+ coffee shops, 2 retail stores, and 2 art galleries over the next three months.\n\n### Description\nWe have observed the success of Nouns' flywheel in Brazil, China, Japan, and other communities. We propose to launch activation campaign in Korea in collaboration with ten authentic coffee shops. This campaign aims to educate people about nouns and engage them in the process. Participants will collect noggle-stamps and have the chance to earn stylish nounish t-shirts as rewards.\n\nOur team firmly believes in our energy and talent to establish Nouns as a prominent pop culture brand in Korea. The campaign will span three months, during which people will receive noggle-stamps with their coffee purchases. Once they collect 10 stamps, they can exchange a coupon card for a nounish t-shirt.\n\nTo ensure widespread exposure, all coffee shops will display posters, t-shirts, and magazines featuring on-chain proposals. Furthermore, these t-shirts will be available for purchase at retail stores and art galleries. We are committed to creating high-quality t-shirts using nounish cc0 content, with additional approval from the artists involved.\n\nFor the successful activation of the nouns community in Korea and the promotion of Nouns in 10+ locations over three months, we kindly request $65,000 in funding.\n\n### The stamp collection campaign\n![](https://i.imgur.com/51HGjJe.jpg)\n\nThe campaign will focus on creating visibility, engaging local community, and establishing a loyal fan base. The coffee shops will become a place for people to gather and learn about nouns through arts on t-shirts and information in magazines.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1e0gbXuh.png)\n\nCoupon cards featuring nouns will be distributed at the coffee shops' counters. We anticipate each coffee shop to distribute around 50-30 coupon cards daily, totaling approximately 27,000 cards throughout the campaign. In our focused campaign, we will give out special coupon cards that need only 2 stamps to people who are interested in blockchain and NFTs through our network of friends.\n\n### T-shirts\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByDeX5Md3.jpg)\n\nT-shirts will be placed in highly visible areas at coffee shops. We'll use Nouns' cc0 content to create a beautiful collection of t-shirts. Our goal is to pleasantly surprise everyone with the quality and spirit of nounish artworks. These t-shirts will be made from scratch specifically for this campaign from high-quality materials and tailored in various styles for both men and women. Each label and tag will feature Noggles and links to Noun's homepage and Twitter account.\n\nWe will strategically strive to get the t-shirts in the hands of pop stars, actors, musicians, and models.\n\nThe t-shirts will be the same as those for prop173, 'Sail in NY,' that received praise from the community for their quality.\n\n### NOUNS.WTF magazine\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkFD93zdn.jpg)\n\nWe propose creating a NOUNS.WTF magazine as a powerful marketing and storytelling tool to convey the campaign's message. The magazine will be cost-effective to design using Canva templates and nounish CC0 content. The magazines will be distributed at partner coffee shops and serve as a guide to NounsDAO.\n\nThe magazine will feature articles about: \n- campaign\n- t-shirt collection\n- top on-chain proposals\n- nounish subdaos\n- overview of government clients.\n- We invite individuals and subdaos to contribute to the magazine's creation. Contact us on Twitter to publish an article or a post ([Nouns Seoul](https://twitter.com/nounsseoul)).\n\n### Coffee shops and other partner properties\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1Zj0T5u3.jpg)\n\nWe are going to collaborate with authentic coffee shops around Seoul. Here are the links to coffee shops located in popular areas such as [Jeongno](https://www.instagram.com/cha.teul/), [Itaewon](https://www.instagram.com/theroyalfad/), and [Sinsa](https://www.instagram.com/minoscoffeecult/). Additionally, we are going to sell t-shirts at popular [Fashion and lifestyle](https://www.instagram.com/niceweather.seoul/) goods stores and [art galleries](https://www.instagram.com/print_bakery/).\n\nAs of now, we onboarded three coffee shops, one retail store, and one art gallery. We can rest of the partner properties recruited in no time.\n\n### Why Korea\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJUNQsvw2.jpg)\n\nKorea is known for its collection of cool nounish items, ranging from sailboats, resin toys, and children's books to motorcycles. In line with this, our goal is to unite and provide a firsthand experience to an increasing number of Nouns' fans. We believe that the timing is ideal to launch a nounish campaign, aiming to showcase the beautiful aspects of Nouns' art, culture, and governance. This initiative will not only attract a larger base of devoted fans but also facilitate the discovery of new nounish memes and contribute to the advancement of nounish culture.\n\n### Timeline\nThe campaign is scheduled to commence in July and continue until October. The team estimates that it will require approximately 3-4 weeks to complete all the necessary preparations.\n1 week - legal matters\n1 week - coffee shop recruitment\n1 week - decorations/logistics\n3 weeks - manufacture 2,000 t-shirts\n3 weeks - design and print NOUNS.WTF magazine\n\n### The team\n1. **[Fiveoceans_dev](https://twitter.com/fiveoceans_dev)** t-shirts manufacturing and distribution\n2. **[Morph](https://www.instagram.com/morphmgmt/)** - legal matters and work with coffee shops.\n3. **[Jhee](https://twitter.com/jheeart_nft)** NOUNS.WTF magazine\n4. **[Duckhead](https://twitter.com/_duckhead)** coffee shops decorations\n\n### Budget\n$35,000 - manufacture 2,000 t-shirts (custom tags with noggles, different styles, artwork press, packaging)\n$10,000 - coffee shops' rental fees (10 coffee shops, 3 months, $330 per month)\n$4,000 - NOUNS.WTF magazine design and printing\n$2,500 - logistics & storage (Ex. 100 t-shirts weight 22 kg or 48 pounds)\n$2,500 - legal, tax, signing contracts with coffee shops, outsourcing  company's fees to conduct business etc\n$3,000 - decorations $300 per coffee shop (10 t-shirt stands, 100 posters, 10 noggle stamps, 27,000 coupon cards, and others)\n$2,000 - photo & video production to document progress and share on SNS\n$6,000 - team's compensation.

Our team has been hard at work programming Nerman's various bots and libraries since then. Check out [nerman.wtf](https://nerman.wtf) for a summary of the project and links to the various code repositories.\n\nIn this proposal we focus our efforts on Nerman.js ([GitHub](https://github.com/JoeCars/Nerman.js), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nerman)), and Nounish feeds using our Discord bot ([GitHub](https://github.com/JoeCars/Nerman)).\n\n---\n\n## NERMAN.JS - NOUNS SDK\n\n---\n\nNerman.js provides simple type-safe access to Nouns DAO contract events, as well as custom events such as Noun O'Clock. The user provides a JSON-RPC url and connects directly to an Ethereum node without any further 3rd party hosted services.\n\nYou can install Nerman.js with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nerman)\n\n**DEMO - NOUN O'CLOCK**\n\n``` typescript\nimport * as nerman from \"nerman\";\n\nconst Nouns = new nerman.Nouns( JSON_RPC_API_URL );\n\nNouns.on(\"AuctionEnd\", (data : nerman.EventData.AuctionEnd) => {\n    \n    // It's Noun O'Clock, do stuff here!!\n\n});\n```\n\nFor more code examples see the ReadMe in [GitHub](https://github.com/JoeCars/Nerman.js). Nerman.js currently supports listening to Nouns DAO events such as auction creation, auction bids, proposal creation, dao votes, Noun creation, Noun transfer, delegation changes, and more. We also launched support for [Nouns Nymz](https://nouns.nymz.xyz/) and have a live feed posting in a Nouns community Discord.\n\n**THE FUTURE**\n\nNerman.js will provide and maintain access to events across the Nouniverse:\n\n- Nouns DAO events across all contracts, including DAO updates (v3) and DAO tools (token buyer)\n- Various events from Nounish projects and tools like Prop House, Nouns Nymz, Federation, Agora, etc. \n- Contract events from Nounish DAOs (Lil Nouns, Gnars, Builder DAO)\n\nNerman.js will index on-chain Nouns data:\n\n- Pre-indexed Nouns data included with library for instant access\n- Manually run the indexer yourself for verification\n- This indexed data allows Nerman to offer more complicated analysis of the data, including reporting behavior of voters, bidders, vote participation rates, etc.\n\nNerman.js will be a canonical source of knowledge about the Nouniverse:\n\n- Our extensive, SEO optimized documentation will help people figure out what Nouns contracts and projects exist and how to best interact with them. Our resources will be a useful starting point for anyone developing in Nouns.\n\n\n---\n\n## DISCORD BOT - NOUNISH FEEDS\n\n---\n\nNerman offers customizable Nounish event feeds for Discord channels, displaying formatted embeds with the main Nouns DAO contract events from Nerman.js. Users can configure which events to display in a channel with a simple command.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyX8b1U_3.jpg)\n\n**CURRENT NOUNISH FEEDS**\n\n- **Agora Discord**\n  Auction and DAO Proposal events in #gov-updates channel\n- **A Nouns Community Discord**\n  Auction and Proposal events in #general channel\n  Nouns Nymz posts in #nouns-nymz\n- **Nouncil**\n  Auctions, Proposals, Token Transfers in Feeds Section\n  Proposal votes and status changes posted in appropriate Prop threads in #nouncil-votes\n\n  \n\n**THE FUTURE**\n\nWe will add all Nerman.js events as we create them, allowing easy Discord notifications from Prop House, Federation, other Nounish DAO's, and anywhere else we can get event feeds from. We will also experiment with different feed ideas using the events we have, for instance creating a feed that only displays Nouns DAO votes with 0 vote weight as an informal on-chain chat.\n\nWe will also develop a way for automated Nouns DAO prop discussions using forums, where a new thread is automatically created for each proposal.\n\n---\n\n## TERMS\n\n---\n\n- funding for the team to continue developing Nerman up to Dec 31, 2023. \n- all code will be open source and released under a permissive license (such as MIT).\n\n---\n\n## TRANSACTION\n\n---\n\n**Total Budget: 93 Ξ**\nJoel Cares (part time) and a team of 2 devs (full time)\n\n**Transaction**\n93 ETH streamed to 0x09b68020Fb9691C2c20687631EDCF16fdFCba277",

          "reason": "Some context, and a few question answers🙏\n\nNerman's first proposal ( https://nouns.wtf/vote/77 ) was very long, specific, and ambitious. We almost entirely automated governance in Nouncil and completed a variety of out-of-scope features to make sure Nouncil's governance ran smoothly. Now, Nouncil is the most active voting member of Nouns DAO, with Nerman automating the 10,000+ votes of over 100 Nouncillors voting on more than 200 Nouns DAO props. We navigated the changing world of Nouns Discords as the official one closed, always building for an expanding decentralized social group. Whenever a good idea arose we implemented further features, like the Nouns Nymz feed. We continued working on the bots, at our own expense, long after the initial proposals end date.\n\nAt the end of the process the feature list felt limiting, preventing us from continuously learning and refining our direction according to user interest and DAO priority. For instance, when we wrote this proposal Nouns had an official Discord. Things change fast here.\n\nI also had several people note (semi-joking, semi-serious) that prop 77 was too long of a read. So - this proposal is shorter and focused on a broader vision over a specific time period. This gives us a clear roadmap, as well as the flexibility to learn, grow, and pivot as we work. \n\nThe primary focus of this prop is actually the Nounish developer SDK, not a discord bot. `npm install nerman`. The first version of the Nerman.js SDK was essential to all the bots we built and one of the most impactful things delivered.\n\nThis proposal is not an extensive documentation of the features we will add. This is a proposal to keep the team focused on the project, working as hard as we can towards the vision specified for 6 months. We are currently a team of three, with me working part time leading, planning, and coding. This proposal does not cover any of my time spent on other Nouns projects - Yitong, you can still expect an ambitious Nouns Short Shorts proposal.\n\nSome of the items here will be very significant to do extensively and correctly. We're not just checking boxes, this library should be the cleanest, most intuitive way of interacting with the Nouniverse. There is easily enough work here for the team to stay busy for 6 months. Each of the features listed is a potential rabbit hole. Properly indexing all Nouns DAO data and coding interesting queries to analyze it, implementing thoughtful connections to all Nouns related projects, implementing all Nounish DAO contracts... these are huge undertakings. On top of that, we intend on responding to an ever changing environment and incorporating new tools and features that pop up as we go. If something is getting traction within Nouns we will try to incorporate it quickly. If the DAO changes significantly, or forks, we will provide connections to all the feeds that need them.\n\nNerman.js will be the simplest way for developers to integrate Nouns events and data into their projects. For devs who want to use their own tooling, Nerman.js documentation will be the simplest place to learn about Nouns DAO contracts and the technical universe of projects surrounding Nouns.",

It feels like the roadmap for purely maintaining bots is limited, and if Joel & team have 3 devs, i'd encourage them to think about additional ways they can contribute on the tooling front. \n\n2. Personally for Joel, I wonder if this prop is also partially funding his ability to work on short shorts. If so, I'd like to see a separate prop focused on an ambitious expansion of that program.\n\nOtherwise, look forward to all the amazing things Joel & team will do :D\n\n- Yitong voting via Agora liquid delegation",

It would be helpful for non-devs to see some practical examples of what these features could deliver.\n\nBudget - I believe there needs to be more clarity here. Some questions that pop to mind: How was the figure decided? How are the funds going to be distributed? Why choose funding in ETH over USDC?\n\nThat being said though, I believe Joel is an absolute integral part of the community and has proven his intent and dedication to Nouns. There are few people that I know truly have the DAO's interest at heart and he is one of them. \nThe sum of the positives here outweigh my concerns, so I'll be voting FOR Joel and his vision.\n\n*sent from voter.wtf*",

Build Nouns Bowling as a Lead Title\nNouns Bowling is a new 3D bowling game built with CC0 assets from the [3D Nouns](https://3dnouns.com) and [Noun Sounds](https://nounsounds.wtf) projects. This game is LIVE on the [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nouns-bowling/id1660679079) today!\n\nBowling is popular on **all gaming platforms** and can blaze a trail for publishing multi-platform Nouns games. Bowling is an approachable, universal game and appeals to all age groups.\n\n### 👉 Play Nouns Bowling: [nounsbowling.app](https://nounsbowling.app)\n![Nouns Bowling](https://i.imgur.com/xqmhQNc.jpg)\n\n[![Nouns Bowling](https://i.imgur.com/5TKGiiU.jpg)](https://youtu.be/A-FBNGRYy4A)\n\nWATCH VIDEO: [Nouns Bowling trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-FBNGRYy4A&list=PLQLUWbPbAeHEdkgI9PFPj7lShFrCg_iPI&index=1)\n\n### Here’s what the funding is for:\n- **Core technology** - build key technology for the other games here\n- **3D Art and Animation** - expand the game and boost production values\n- **Metagame** - features to wrap core gameplay, reusable in other games\n- **Teams feature** - adding team competition between Nouns houses\n- **Prizes feature** - adding prize competitions for game nights\n\n⭐ *Includes new 3D bowling alleys for Nouns communities:*\n\n* **Nouns Alley** - the original alley for the OG Nouns\n* **Lil Nouns Lanes** - a big bowling alley for the Lil Nouns\n* **FOODNOUNs Bowl** - tasty environment with an OTG angle\n* **Gnarly Bowl** - a gnarly alley for extreme bowling athletes\n\n---\n\n## Part 2. Establish the Nouns CC0 Gaming Toolkit\nAs we build Nouns Bowling, we'll create the **Nouns CCO Gaming Toolkit**:\n\n* **3D Nouns characters** - game-ready Unity assets based on [3D Nouns](https://3dnouns.com)\n* **2D Nouns characters** - game-ready Unity assets from [Nouns Sprite Sheets](https://nouns.wtf/vote/201)\n* **Famous Characters** - famous Nouns NPC characters with AI features\n* **Nouns 3D environments** - models and other 3D assets \n* **Useful Unity systems** - to help devs build Nouns games quickly\n\n### Competitive Advantage for Nouns\nNo traditional games business would release 3D characters, environments and gaming IP into the public domain. **What if Mario was a CC0 brand?** 🤯\n\n![Nouns 3D Characters in Unity](https://i.imgur.com/6eGYUvg.gif)\n\n🕺 Game-ready **3D Nouns** ready to rock\n\n### ⭐ Including this BONUS item ...\n![Rose Parade Nouns Float](https://i.imgur.com/FVe75yc.jpg)\n\n![Rose Parade Nouns Float](https://i.imgur.com/PdwSIRV.png)\n\n🚧 3D model of the Rose Parade Float - as seen in Nouns Bowling 🚧\n\n### Rose Parade float CC0 asset:\n- Game-ready Unity package with characters and animations\n- FBX assets for use in Blender or other game engines like Unreal\n- Rendered images for use in videos or on websites\n\n⭐ *Just one example of a useful Nouns 3D gaming asset!*\n\n---\n\n## Part 3. Fire Up a Game Publishing Pipeline 🔥\n### Process for prototyping and shipping Nouns games\nCompetition in games is fierce - only the **top games** in each genre survive. Two ways to win: be a top game in an existing genre, or create a **new game genre**. \n\nLots of prototyping, with rounds of cuts, is the method used by savvy game businesses.\n\n### Pipeline Steps\n1. **Proposals** - generate new ideas and proposals\n2. **Prototypes** - build prototypes for web\n3. **Betas** - fund betas for web and iOS\n4. **Ship** - ship top games on web, mobile\n5. **Publish** - take Nouns games to new gaming platforms\n\n![Nouns Publishing Pipeline](https://i.imgur.com/0Z8HLPr.png)\n\nThis game publishing pipeline is designed to deliver a **stream of prototypes** to playtest, while attracting new builders to Nouns. \n\nThis proposal delivers **12 prototypes** and **6 winners** will be pubished as iOS apps.\n\n---\n\n## Part 4. Launch a Nouns gaming website\n### Purpose\n* First place to launch prototypes (early access for NFT holders)\n* Run beta testing before shipping games to mobile\n* Best platform for web3 experiments and innovation\n\n### Playable Prototypes\n\n[![Nouns Game Site](https://i.imgur.com/D7xZuVA.png)](https://nounsgames.wtf)\n\n🕹️ You can play these game prototypes at [**nounsgames.wtf**](https://nounsgames.wtf)\n\n### Future Website\nImagine a web gaming site like [Poki.com](https://poki.com) where ALL games are Nouns games!\n\n### No Gatekeepers\nThese web games will run on **mobile devices in a browser**!\n... this is a solution for **mobile gaming** without App Stores\n\n*NOTE: we **will** also publish iOS apps with advanced features*\n\n---\n\n## Part 5. Publish and Evolve Nouns Games\n![Evolution](https://i.imgur.com/HCODOxx.png)\n\n### Marketing and Evolution\nThe marketing fund (24 ETH) will be used to onboard new players to Nouns through games, while providing insight into customer preferences.\n\nGaming metrics - engagement and retention - help make decisions on:\n\n* Which prototypes to fund\n* When a beta is ready to ship\n* When to scale up advertising\n\nRound by round, games evolve, and small experiments guide the way.\n\nEvolution rules.\n\n---\n\n# Discord Strategy\n\n## Provide games for existing Nouns communities\n* Web games are easy to decentralize and customize for communities\n* Our standard web build has Daily high scores - perfect for prizes\n* Each game we build is designed for one or more communities\n\n## Build a new Discord for game devs\n\nDiscord is the best place for:\n* Onboarding game devs to Nouns\n* Trying new game prototypes\n* Review of gaming metrics\n* Brainstorming new game concepts\n* Experimenting with new technology like AR\n\n#### 👉 Join the [Nouns Games Discord](https://discord.gg/Ez3KnkrrVk) server\n\n---\n\n# Design Philosophy\n\n## Building Apps for the Whole World\n\nThe [Nouns Virtuous Cycle](https://medium.com/@punk4156/the-nouns-virtuous-cycle-95586bb9c7c9) calls for \"consumer apps the whole world wants to use\"\n\n![Nouns Virtuous Cycle](https://i.imgur.com/yh7H6BX.jpg)\n\nDid punk4156 foresee a gaming future? 🤔\n#### 🌎 *The whole world wants to use Nouns games ...* 🕹️😺\n\n### Games are consumer apps ...\n* Played across all gaming devices and age groups\n* Games are played by **3 billion people** worldwide\n* **Casual games** play to the largest audience\n\n### Simple games are the most universal ...\nHere are 5 genres of game with broad appeal\n* 2D Puzzle games\n* 2D Platform Hopper games\n* 3D Kart driving games\n* 3D Sports titles (think Wii Sports)\n* Simple multiplayer games (for communities)\n\n\n### Web games on mobile are the new frontier ...\n\n[![Alps Snowboarding](https://i.imgur.com/qlc8ieW.gif)](https://nounsgames.wtf/snowboarding)\n\n👉 *[3D snowboarding](https://nounsgames.wtf/snowboarding) runs in Safari on iPhone!*\n\n---\n\n# Budget\n### Summary\n\n* Gaming Website - **20 ETH**\n* Game Production - **155 ETH**\n* Marketing Fund - **24 ETH**\n\n## 💰 199 ETH Total\n\n---\n\n## Budget Breakdown\n### Gaming Website - 20 ETH\n* Design, build and launch the [**nounsgames.wtf**](https://nounsgames.wtf) gaming website\n* Publish web games and prototypes for playtesting\n* Prepare web games for publishing across the Nouniverse\n\n### Nouns Bowling - 35 ETH\n![Bowling Budget](https://i.imgur.com/NGr70PB.png)\n\n### 5 New Games - 100 ETH\nDesigned with **specific Nouns communities** in mind\n![Games Budget Table](https://i.imgur.com/nNUTAts.png)\n\n### 6 New Prototypes - 10 ETH\n* Establish a fund for prototyping new web games\n* Finding new **blue ocean mechanics** is one goal\n* Testing new **game development talent** is another\n\n### Nouns CC0 Unity Gaming Toolkit - 10 ETH\n* Nouns 3D Characters for Unity game developers\n* Nouns 3D Environments for use across Unity games\n* Rose Parade Float CC0 model for community projects\n* Useful Unity systems to quickly add Nouns to games\n* Deliver as a FREE Unity Asset Store package\n\n### Marketing Fund - 24 ETH\nRun measurable advertising experiments to inform design\n* Small paid advertising experiments bring in new players\n* Campaign results help inform the game design process\n* Web game metrics help select the games to ship as iOS apps\n\n### Budget Details\nWe are asking for a total of **199 ETH**\n\n* Art - **52.5 ETH**\n* Design - **17.5 ETH**\n* Engineering - **105 ETH**\n* Marketing - **24 ETH**\n\n### Multi-Sig & Transactions\nUpon successfully passing the prop, **199 ETH** will be sent to a 6 person multi-sig requiring 3 signatures for each send:\n\n1. modrovsky\n2.

No.\nThere will be no DAO for this project. Here's why:\n* There are a LOT of Nouns DAOs, let's build games for those\n* Game selection by DAO vote may not be the best option\n* Better to keep freedom for individual games to have DAOs\n\n### What about running ads in the games?\nRunning annoying ads between levels ruins a lot of good games. But **rewarded ads** and **sponsorships** can work. In-game ads can also **promote other Nouns projects**.\n\nRunning video ads featuring Nouns **in other people's games** is one advertising strategy. Nouns get video views AND game installs.\n\n### What about Tokens and Play-to-Earn?\n**Hot take:** Nouns games should AVOID play-to-earn cryptocurrency models. Gone wrong, they can do more damage to the Nouns brand than good. We don't plan on issuing a token or using play-to-earn tokenomics.\n\n---\n\n# Collabs\n### Games play well with other Nouns projects ...\nDecentralizing games across communities through collabs. This is big.\n\n![Collabs](https://i.imgur.com/zkWUEuI.jpg)\n\n# Future Proposals\n\nObjective is to bring **ambitious gaming proposals** to NounsDAO, for example:\n\n**Games Meets Toys**\nFunding to connect games and toys, loading toys into games, AR features\n\n**Collabs with other Nouns Projects**\nGames x Nouns opens up new opportunities for Nouns communities\n\n**Publishing Games to PC and Consoles**\nPublish games for Mac, PC, Steam, Epic, and consoles (hello Nintendo)\n\n**Game Dev Hackathons**\nFunding for hackathons to create new prototypes and web games\n\n**Scaling Up Nouns Proliferation with Games**\nOnboarding people to Nouns with games, by scaling up successful advertising experiments. Proliferation on demand, to desired audiences, with measurable ROI.\n\n---\n\n# Outcome\n\n### ✅ Nouns Communities get Powered Up\nDecentralized web games for Nouns communities unlock new business models\n\n### ✅ Nouns Solves its Game Funding Problem\nNouns Game Publisher helps NounsDAO make smart investments in games\n\n### ✅ Indie Game Developers Flock to Nouns\nGame publishing pipeline and CC0 toolkit attracts new talent to Nouns\n\n### ✅ Games Get Less Expensive to Market\nA network of Nouns games is less expensive to advertise. For example:\n* Pay for 1 install, games link to 6 games, 7 installs for the price of 1\n* Advertise a games website with 7 games, per-game ad costs reduced by 85%\n* Proliferation efforts for **one** Nouns game helps elevate **all** Nouns games\n\n### ✅ NounsDAO Gets Quality Gaming Proposals ⌐◨-◨\nWhen a new game proposal is brought to the DAO, a game should:\n1. Be playable\n2. Have base metrics\n3. Show promising early results\n\nFunding risk is lower, success is more likely. NounsDAO can **scale up successful games** to proliferate Nouns anywhere in the world.\n\n# Nouns = Open Source Nintendo?\nMushrooms, bombs, stars, clouds ... they *already exist* as Nouns 🤯\n\n[![Nounio Bros](https://i.imgur.com/Y625qy0.gif)](https://nounsgames.wtf)\n\n**Play this prototype** (and more) at [**nounsgames.wtf**](https://nounsgames.wtf) \n# LFGame!\n## Thank you for voting YES on Nouns games 🕹️😁",

      "description": "# Expanding Global Distribution of Lo-Fi Noggles\n\nAs a veteran manufacturer in the Nouns ecosystem, [NOUNWORKS](https://twitter.com/nounworks) has a proven pipeline for delivering quality products. We would like to place Noggles onto the faces of every Nounish person on the planet. We are requesting funding to create another run of Lo-Fi Noggles. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkK1-Kqr3.jpg)\n*25K+ Lo-Fi Noggles to supply large-scale IRL events*\n\n# STEP 1: Decide who gets what\n\nWith this production run we plan on outfitting various active members of the global Nouns community so that their IRL events are even more Nounish. \n\nWe will survey groups to understand their needs, and we will accept requests and inquiries from people writing props or planning events. \n\n**Note that this survey has already begun in the Discourse [here](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/worldwide-lo-fi-noggles-everey-where-reorder/4674) and many groups have already confirmed a strong interest in receiving shipments of the Lo-Fi Noggles:**\n\n**Nouns Running:** *\"As the founder of the Nouns Running Club, I can say that we REALLY need these. We had a small batch of 30 donated by another grantee, and they went like hotcakes. People really liked them and it was a good way for people to feel good after a run and they just GOT the good vibes.\"*\n\n**Pizza DAO:** *\"Was incredibly excited to be able to distribute these at our Global Pizza Event. Also, having them at our events offered another layer of experience for our party attendees by offering them as a “prop-for-participation” (it was great for attendees to be able to jump in a photo or video and play “pass the noggles,” etc…while meeting up for some pizza). Enjoy the energy this can bring to events all over! Would love to get a bunch for future events!\"*\n\n**Mucho Love:** *\"Lo-Fi Noggles are more than just fun cardboard eyewear for Mucho Love. They serve as a tangible manifestation of the spirit and ethos of our organization. As we engage in our various activations, these Noggles serve as an icebreaker, a conversation starter, and a symbol of our commitment to spreading joy and positivity. They enhance our content’s recognizability, making it stand out and resonate with audiences familiar with Nouns. They are instrumental in fostering community, spreading our message, and enhancing the impact of our work.\"\"*\n\n**Serpunk:** *I think this is a good idea. A low budget option to nounify any event should exist and I believe this is it!*\n\n**Nouns in Rio:** *\"We definitely need those for Nouns in Rio/NounsBR events!*\n\n**Nouns Amigos:** *\"Noggles set the vibes for any IRL event! Definitely needed for Nouns Amigos community ⌐◨-◨\"*\n\n**Gnars:** *\"Be very keen to reserve 2500 pieces for Gnars and Art Haus related events!\"*\n\n**Nouns Whisky:** *\"this is awesome! We could distribute 3000 of them.\"*\n\n\n\n[MANY more positive reactions and support / requests for this prop here](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/worldwide-lo-fi-noggles-everey-where-reorder/4674/7).\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1r1Yuk_3.jpg)\n\n# STEP 2: Produce more Lo-Fi paper Noggles \n\nFactory produces what we need to outfit Nounish groups worldwide (we are estimating 25K units). \n\n# STEP 3: Ship worldwide\n\nCases of Lo-Fi Noggles ship to Nounish groups directly from factory.\n\n# STEP 4: Remaining units held in USA for future use\n\nThe rest of the production run (if there are any extras) will be shipped to our warehouse in USA to be allocated and distributed as needed.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SySXKByr2.jpg)\n\n# Why do it this way? \n\nThis plan avoids chaos and increases production and logistical efficiency. (End result: better and more accurately planned proliferation of Nouns on a global scale).\n\n# This round of production:\nThese are the high quality cardboard versions of our classic Noggles design, but created in a flat packed / inexpensive format. Each pair comes packaged with an informative backer card and is easily shipped and distributed at events worldwide. \n\nThis run will improve with heavier cardstack, a 2-sided full color backer card, and a polybag.\n\nLo-Fi Noggles come packed in 50-piece bundles and can be produced and shipped in very large quantities to Nounify even the biggest events. \n\n\n# Why 25K units?\n\nWe feel that 25K pieces is a small ask based on the popularity and the huge need for affordable and easily shipped Noggles around the world. \n\nWe will survey Nouns community members to find out what quantities each of them may require for their upcoming activations.\n\nFinal quantity depends on requests from active Nouns community, event planners and creators.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJXUFuJOn.jpg)\n\n\n# Who is slated to receive Lo-Fi Noggles?\nBelow is a list of some of the active communities that we are considering. They are scattered around the world and host / organize frequent IRL events: \n\n* [Esports](https://twitter.com/nounsesports): 3000-5000 pcs for ongoing local and global events\n* [NOUNS RUNNING](https://twitter.com/NounsRC):  3000-5000 pcs for ongoing local and global events\n* [Nouns Amigos](https://twitter.com/NounsDAOAmigos):   3000-5000 pcs for ongoing local and global events\n* [NOUNS Africa](https://twitter.com/nounsDAOAfrica)\n* [GNARS](https://twitter.com/gnars_dao): 3000 pcs for ongoing local and global events\n* [Alps Dao](https://twitter.com/AlpsDAO) \n* [NOUNS WHISKEY](https://twitter.com/Nouns_Whisky): 3000 pcs for ongoing local and global events\n* [Profwerder](https://twitter.com/ProfWerder): 1000 pcs for ongoing local events\n* [NOUNS Brazil](https://twitter.com/nounsbr)\n* [Nouns Latin America](https://twitter.com/NounsLatam)\n* [NOUNS OTG](https://twitter.com/OTGWTF)\n* [PIZZA DAO](https://twitter.com/Pizza_DAO): 3000-5000 pcs for ongoing local and global events\n* [Australian Open](https://twitter.com/AustralianOpen)\n* [NFT Paris](https://twitter.com/nft_paris)\n* [Nouns Deli](https://twitter.com/NounsDeli): 3000-5000 pcs for ongoing local and global events (USA to Australia shipping is very expensive so this one is great for the team)\n* Free Glasses For Kids / Vision Van\n* **If anyone else has a need for 1000+ pairs of Noggles for an activation, please DM us.**\n\n\n# Improved unit cost:\n$1.95 + shipping, minimum 25K units to achieve this pricing, no maximum order size. [Previous order](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/low-fi-nounish-noggles-by-bigshot/2103/59) costed $2.40/unit.\n\nWorldwide shipping costs average to $350 per carton of 1000, and we'd make minimum of 25 cartons. \n\n# Total ask for 25K units:\n$57,000 in USDC deposited into the Nounworks projects wallet:\n\n\n[0xd25912007EBC2527d4ED9DC536f928E550b0f02C](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd25912007EBC2527d4ED9DC536f928E550b0f02C)\n\n# Why now?\nTo ensure we can distribute the Noggles worldwide ASAP, we aim to place our order with the printer as soon as possible.\n\n\n# After we ship to Nouns community members: \n\nWarehousing, administrative, and shipping fees TBD after the remainder gets to the USA, handled on a case by case basis. (See next prop which deals with ongoing funding for distribution of Nouns merch to members of the community).\n\nIn general once the unclaimed units get back to our USA warehouse, the cost to turn around and ship them again will be $2 per unit for the Lo-Fi Noggles and $2 more to ship them. They are in packs of 50 so that would be $200 shipped to get a pack of 50 back out to another country. That cost will be covered by the recipients or their props.\n\n# Info about our previous order:\n10K units were paid for by Nouns DAO (NSFW) and an additional 3K units were paid for by Bigshot. All have since been dispersed globally, sold out and gone. All faces wearing Lo-Fi Noggles were happy faces!\n\n# So what's next?\n\nGlad you asked. [We will have a follow-up prop that will fund our ongoing supply of our Nounish merch to members of the Nouns community worldwide](https://hackmd.io/@bigshot/BJSZdHJBh    ). This will complete the proliferation machine and will ensure a constant stream of Nounish merch to the doors of the right organizations. Let's go!\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJkXY_Jdh.jpg)",

Otherwise, when is the next request, or the next one, or the next one...\n\nIt's absolutely fine to request that event organizers contribute towards the cost of these novel additions to their events. \n\nA little friction can sometimes be necessary and there are instances when it's best to eliminate the intermediary, similar to Ethereum.\n\nRecently I've observed piles of unused stickers from events which left me hesitant for this one, yes even noggle stickers that were not just handed out by randos to randos.\n\nI truly appreciate the LO-FI Noggles and am delighted to see them at a lower production cost, but with what I have seen unused and thrown away from similar items I feel so much apprehension to be a straight \"hell yeah\" on this.\n\nI want to reiterate, I would be very much interested in a prop that funded you and nounworks as a viable business that becomes self-sufficient in its operations.",

As I've mentioned earlier, I've been to a few IRL events recently and people really embrace the noggles and the fun around it, even if they aren't involved with the project. This is one of the best things going for DAO and we need to keep it rolling.\n\nMy only feedback on the proposal is that it's not clear whether Nounswork is getting paid for this work.

So I would be a proponent of charging a small fee, let's say 10 cents per lo-fi noggle.

      "description": "# NounsTennisFam (Feature Nouns/Noggles in grand slams/major tennis events and fund upcoming athletes)\n\n# Objective and Overview\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/W4qgnt8s/2.png)\n\n**NounsTennisFam (NTF)** is a Web3 sports platform co-founded by ATP Rank 15 tennis player, Borna Ćorić, and led by CEO Bruno Pliso. Forbes has recognized the platform for its innovative approach to revolutionizing the tennis industry. NTF is now ready to take the next steps in fostering the development of elite tennis talent, enhancing fan engagement, and positioning NounsDAO in front of a global audience of hundreds of millions.\n\nTo achieve these goals, NTF will harness its tennis stars as brand ambassador powerhouses. They will compete in custom NTF Noggles apparel at some of the world's biggest sporting events and actively promote NounsTennisFam through their impressive social media reach. Additionally, NTF will provide a fairer and more transparent on-chain infrastructure for developing elite tennis talent and democratizing the sport.\n\nBy supporting emerging players and enhancing fan engagement, NTF will make a mark on the industry, paving the way for a sustainable ecosystem for talent development, sponsorship opportunities, and interactive experiences. This will leave a legacy and transform NounsTennisFam into a well-known and respected name in the industry.\n\nIn line with NounsDAO's mission of decentralization and community-driven initiatives, NTF will offer a comprehensive suite of resources for professional and aspiring tennis players, including funding, training, and community support. Empowering pros, prospects, and fans and transforming them into a community of benefactors invested in one another's success is the future of sports. Together, let's change the game and establish NounsTennisFam as a major force in professional tennis.\n\n# TL;DR\n\nNounsTennisFam is set to revolutionize the tennis industry through blockchain technology and democratization of the sport by providing fair compensation for investors and talent. With the goal of becoming a cornerstone of the global tennis market valued at $5.6 billion, NounsTennisFam aims to represent athletes and connect fans under the NounsDAO banner in front of millions of fans worldwide.\n\n## Key Objectives\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/3Jn3LBfZ/3.png)\n- Noggles and NounsTennisFam (NTF) branded jerseys to be worn by co-founder Borna Coric (World No 20 Croatian tennis star) in grand slams and other major events, with millions of views and discussions about Nouns and NTF in pre/post-match press conferences.\n- Develop the \"NounsTennisFam\" platform to support up-and-coming athletes by funding them through the issuance of their own digital collectibles, which translates to a portion of the athletes' future game/endorsement earnings.\n- Gain support from athletes such as Real Madrid/Croatian football star Luka Modric, Grand Slam winner Marin Cilic, and others in Borna's network.\n- Provide branded NTF/Noggles competition apparel for all NTF-sponsored athletes, seen by millions.\n- Support underprivileged communities to ensure that economics do not stand in the way of talent.\n- Create new opportunities for fans to interact with sports, invest, and be a part of an athlete's journey from the beginning while learning about web 3 in the process.\n- Establish NounsTennis Fam as a household name in professional sports.\n\nThis collaboration presents a tremendous opportunity for NounsDAO to gain incredible exposure before a global audience and create lasting value for the brand while supporting emerging prospects and established professionals in the tennis industry.\n\n# Opportunity of a Lifetime\n\n## Tennis Viewership Numbers Reveal the Sport's Widespread Appeal and Growing Popularity\n\nMajor tournaments, all of which NTF Co-founder, Borna competes in, attract millions of viewers worldwide. In 2021, Wimbledon reached a global audience of over 500 million viewers, while the French Open and the Australian Open had 350 million and 900 million viewers, respectively (source: Grand Slam Board). This global audience provides a significant opportunity for NounsTennisFam to engage a passionate user base and secure NounsDAO significant exposure before an army of loyal fans.\n\n## Sports on the Blockchain\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, Inc., the global sports market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.3% from 2020 to 2027, driven by increasing participation in sports, the rising popularity of sports leagues, and the growing demand for sports-related merchandise. Although this report does not specifically address tennis, a Nielsen Sports report forecasts tennis viewership to continue growing in the United States, fueled by top players' popularity and the rise of new stars like Coco Gauff. The US Open, in particular, has experienced significant growth, with a 33% increase in average audience per match in 2021 compared to the previous year. This suggests the potential for the sport to continue to grow in popularity and reach new audiences, offering a substantial opportunity for NounsDAO to engage with a large audience eager for innovative solutions like the NounsTennisFam platform.\n\n## Success stories\n\n### Tennis Australia\n\nTennis Australia collaborated with the Australian Open to incorporate blockchain technology and NFTs into the event. The final bounce of winning points was linked to corresponding NFTs known as \"Artballs.\" Fans owning these NFTs won various rewards, such as tickets to the next year's tournament. The Australian Open also utilized the metaverse, creating a replica of the Rod Laver Arena in Decentraland and engaging with millions of users in a Roblox experience.

The NTF dApp enables fans to sponsor young and underprivileged players through funds generated by launchpad mints and commercial sponsorship deals. \n2. **Player Exclusive Launchpad & Drops**: This feature allows established players and potential professionals to tokenize a portion of their anticipated earnings, providing financial support. The platform offers two types of drops: Professional Drops (seasonal tokens) and Prospect Drops (sponsorship tokens), catering to different stages of a player’s career. \n3. **The Fam Section**: An exclusive content and social networking dashboard for NTF Asset holders, providing access to exclusive content, networking opportunities, and various benefits determined by the athletes. \n4. **Athletes & Valuation**: The platform features verified ATP and WTA players and up-and-coming prospects, with advisory and selection support from Borna’s management agency, Kozmos Holding. Drops are valued individually, with tokens representing a fraction of the total fractionalized prize money. Professional player valuations are based on historical performance data and a proprietary model, while prospect valuations involve negotiations and selection for either a Prospect pool or a Player exclusive drop, guided by the expertise of Kozmos Holding.\n\nTogether, NounsTennisFam and NounsDAO can actively support emerging tennis superstars by addressing one of their most significant challenges–funding, while providing a framework for established professionals to enter the Web3 space through fractionalized earnings. This approach will strengthen our brand and further democratizes the sport of tennis. Additionally, this collaboration will place NounsTennisFam at the forefront of a vast global tennis market, valued at $5.6 billion in 2019 (Source: ITF). Notably, 46% of global tennis fans have a household income of $75,000 or more (Source: ITF), representing a demographic well-suited to become NounsDAO community members.\n\n# Existing Partnerships and Collaborations\n\nNounsTennisFam has already established integral strategic partnerships with tennis academies, professional players, sport management giants, and Web3 projects that enhance the platform’s features and user experience. Our collaborations within the tennis industry allow us to tap into the impressive viewership numbers of events, such as the Wimbledon 2019, with a peak audience of 9.6 million viewers in the UK alone (Source: BBC), and the French Open 2020 final, with a peak audience of 3.3 million viewers in France (Source: SportsPro). \n\nThese partnerships provide credibility and enable NounsTennisFam to engage with tennis fans and connect with Web3 natives through our blockchain partners.

I believe having the noggles on jerseys is an effective proliferation tool and a way to gain global awareness. Even if it's just on a subconscious level we would be exposing the noggles to a huge audience.\n\nThat being said I have a few issues with this prop. Mainly I sensed a disconnect from Nouns, it feels a bit like Nouns is being used as a stepping stone. I would've liked to see more on how one would collaborate with the other and how the project would incorporate nounish values.\nAlso would've been nice to see some engagement from Borna and other players, showing interest in Nouns and in this partnership.\n\nA note on the proposal itself - it goes on too many tangents and makes it hard to follow exactly what is being asked and its objectives.\nVoting against right now, but open to revisit if the issues are addressed.\n\n*sent from voter.wtf*",

It is the largest democratically populated chronicling of the NFT space, and with the support of the NOUNSDAO, we aim to spread the word of web3, NOUNS, and cryptoart around the world, claiming our shared narrative and telling the story of web3 through the eyes of those building it.\n\nThe project has chronicled the web3 narrative from the very beginning to 2022, featuring contributions from over 550 artists, collectors, founders, creators, and community members through a democratic nomination process. The yearbook is a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning more about the history and future of web3.\n\nWe believe that NOUNSDAO is a perfect fit for supporting the NFT Yearbook project. The DAO is a community of dedicated web3 enthusiasts who are passionate about spreading the word about this new technology. With the DAO's support, we can reach a wider audience and make a greater impact.\n  \n\nIn collaboration with NOUNSDAO, we propose:\na) Adding the NOUNS DAO logo, visuals, and content to all 3000 NFT Yearbooks.\nb) Creating a limited edition NFT Yearbook with a custom NOUNS cover, to be airdropped to all NOUNS holders.\nc) Printing and strategically placing 100 additional custom NOUNSDAO NFT Yearbooks around the world in strategic libraries / museums such as Harvard Business School, which has already collected 2 NFT Yearbooks for its libraries and permanent archives.\n\nThe total cost for this proposal is 88.6815 Ξ\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B163wP6Eh.jpg)\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe NFT Yearbook project has captured a snapshot of the rapidly evolving web3 landscape. It's a comprehensive 420-page, 6.9lbs coffee table book, and a 3D digital readable. It spotlights over 550 artists, collectors, founders, creators, and community members, including many NOUNS fam.\nLink to participants list: https://twitter.com/i/lists/1559260935520411650 \n\nThroughout the past year, we've accumulated over 750 hours of recorded interviews, encapsulating the web3 narrative from the perspectives of those actively shaping it.\n\nA notable aspect of our project is its community-driven nature. The book was co-written and co-curated by the community. Each interviewee nominated other participants for the book, ensuring diversity, equality, and inclusivity.\n\nWe've also introduced a unique feature to increase engagement: blank content spaces as rarity traits. These spaces allow random NFT holders to contribute to the final version of the book, both digital and physical.\n\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJHoroBDn.png)](https://player.vimeo.com/video/826545378)\n\n\n*A 1/1 cover created by 0xDariush*\n\nBeing a 100% bootstrapped and small team, we've strived to ensure that all artists involved in the project can profit from their contributions by creating a 1:1 cover for the book, auctioned on SuperRare, with 100% of the profits returning to the artists.\n\nIn a month and a half, our [1/1 sales](https://superrare.com/series/0x1e3eac91085df57b4aa417b1471349d0bdb19152) have reached 58.150Ξ. Moreover, three artists were invited to SuperRare thanks to the NFT Yearbook project. 79 artists participated in the 1/1 covers and our all-time high sale was 10ETH by thr33som3s.\n\nOur main collection of NFT Yearbooks is hosted on OpenSea, and we've sold 1277 units out of the 3000 total, to date.\n\nWe're proud to announce that the NFT Yearbook was already collected by libraries at Harvard University/HBS, and the books will be placed in their permanent archives. This opportunity would place a NOUNS DAO limited edition cover yearbook in two of the most significant academic libraries globally, cementing its cultural significance.\n\nWith this proposal, we aim to increase the reach of the NOUNSDAO with the historically important content of the NFT Yearbook, to an additional 100 locations worldwide (famed libraries, galleries, etc.)= more NOUNS, everywhere!\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJcF8D6Nn.jpg)\n\n## Project Details\n\nThe NFT Yearbook is a pioneering project that combines the physical and digital realms of art and literature. This 420-page coffee table book, weighing in at 6.9 lbs, captures the web3 narrative from the perspective of those who are actively building it. It is also available as a 3D digital readable yearbook, enhancing the experience of the readers.\n\nOver 550 artists, collectors, founders, creators, and community members, many from NOUNSDAO, are featured in this comprehensive collection. The book is a testament to the vibrancy and diversity of the web3 community, serving as a historical record of the NFT space till 2022.\n\nOur team has spent over 750 hours recording interviews, providing a wealth of insights and experiences. Additionally, each interviewee was given the opportunity to nominate other participants. This democratic approach to curation ensures that the final product is a true reflection of the community's diversity and inclusivity.\n\nThe NFT Yearbook is more than just a static record. It's a participatory project that invites engagement from its readers. A unique feature of the book is the opportunity for all holders to submit content for a blank space, making it a truly community-curated project.\n\n\n![](https://nftyearbook.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Video_23-02-05_12-13-53-2.gif)\n\n**The Team**\nThe book is created and published by Metaverse Publishing, a new bootstrapped web3 company lead by co-founders @CryptoForager81, (Sol Fayerman-Hansen) the ex-head of innovation at the Bank of Montreal and active in blockchain since 2014, and, @CryptoDashi (Dan Stern) who has 10 years of experience in e-Commerce entrepreneurship and DTC experiences creation.\nBoth have been degening since 2017. \nThe third co-founder of Metaverse Publishing is a storied IRL coffee table book publisher with 30-years of experience and 300+ physical coffee table books produced, printed and shipped globally -Global Village Publishing.\n\n**Metaverse Publishing**\nThe NFT Yearbook is our first step, our contribution to this space.\nThis unique web3 + in-house IRL publishing capability positions Metaverse Publishing to create some real dope sh*t, and it all starts with The NFT Yearbook.\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyfUUwT4h.jpg)\n\n## Market Validation\n\nThe NFT Yearbook project has already demonstrated its appeal and relevance within the community. In just a short span of time, we've managed to attract a passionate, dedicated community that actively participates in the project's development.\n\nThe project's notability extends beyond our community. The NFT Yearbook has been recognized by prestigious institutions, including Harvard University, which has included the yearbook in its library collection. This validation from such a renowned educational institution emphasizes the yearbook's cultural and academic significance.\n\nThe community's response has been overwhelmingly positive, with active engagement and enthusiasm for the project. NOUNS DAO members have been integral to the project, participating in decisions, suggesting ideas, and contributing content.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rySrovaEn.jpg)\n\n\n## Goals and Milestones\nHere are our specific goals and milestones:\n\n1. **Finalize the book design with NOUNS DAO:** With the funding, we aim to finalize the design of the book, incorporating the NOUNS DAO community's feedback and ensuring the highest quality. The NFT Yearbook is complete outside of NOUNS DAO content.\n   \n2. **Production:** Upon design finalization, we'll move into production. Each NFT Yearbook comes in digital and physical form, each beautifully bound and printed to the highest standards.\n\n3. **Distribution:** Once the yearbooks are printed, we will handle distribution. We aim to distribute the yearbooks to strategic libraries (two libraries at Harvard have already collected the book and will be placed in their permanent archives), institutions, and individuals around the world, thereby spreading the influence and reach of our community's creative output. For any NOUNS that do not wish to receive their physical books to their address (anons), they will have the option of allowing us to place their books wherever they would like them...schools, libraries, hotels, etc.\n\n4. **Community Engagement:** As a key part of our mission, we will continue to engage our community in the development and refinement of the NFT Yearbook project. This includes seeking their input on design, content, and distribution strategies.\n\n5. **Placing 100 Limited Edition NOUNS Cover Yearbooks In Strategic Libraries / Museums :** With the funding of this prop, Metaverse Publishing will print ( and create the NFTs ) of 100 NOUNS cover NFT Yearbooks and place them in Strategic libraries and institutions. We'll start with Harvard Business School which has already collected 2 NFT Yearbooks for its permanent libraries. We'll seek the community's support and recommendations to assist with this important mission. \n\n6. **Future Editions:** Securing this funding will help set the foundation for the production of future editions of the NFT Yearbook, ensuring that this becomes a tradition within our community, celebrating and documenting our achievements each year with NOUNS as a central figure in the future publications.\n\n7. **NOUNS 3D books** The NFT Yearbook will revolutionize NOUNSDAO book projects (past and future) by transforming them into interactive 3D readable books that can be minted, have AR and VR capabilities, can be read in virtual worlds, etc. \n\n8. **Open-source / free tools** We will give all NOUNSDAO community first access to our open-source and free 3D book creation software, which empowers artists and authors to create immersive and interactive books, enabling them to bring their stories to life in a captivating three-dimensional environment.\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByUlBoSv3.png)](https://player.vimeo.com/video/826536881)\n\n\n*The latest sample - the layout displayed is not final*\n\n## The Impact\n→ Spreading the love: NOUNS will enter up to 3,075 new homes + 100 major, strategic public locations, worldwide.\n\n→ NOUNS and the NFT Yearbook go to Harvard Business School + 100 libraries / museums / galleries / schools...forever!\nThe NFTYB was collected by 2 libraries in Harvard Business School and once printed, will be placed in Baker Library and the main Harvard library on campus. Plus, we will reserve 10 additional units to be collected by future libraries/archives.\n\n→ Supporting the largest-ever chronicling of the space, and contributing to this historical project.\n\n→ Supporting an innovative bootstrapped web3 company, seeking to spearhead publishing 3.0 and empower the next gen of creators of web3.\n\n→ Create a new experience for past and future books supported by the DAO. We’re working on making all Metaverse Publishing books compatible in online galleries, VR and AR platforms, as well as metaverse platforms (for example, OnCyber).\n\n\n## Project Timeline\n\nNFT Yearbook Timeline:\n\nInterviews: Completed prior to the timeline start.\nWriting of the Book: Completed prior to the timeline start.\nPublic Sale: Completed prior to the timeline start.\n\nRemaining Tasks:\n\n**Completion of Community Content (May 2023):**\nMay 1-28, 2023: Gather and review community submissions (including NOUNSDAO).\nMay 16-25, 2023: Samples - Quality control checks and adjustments, if necessary.\nMay 28-31, 2023: Incorporate the community content into the book and prepare the finalized book layout for printing.\n\n**Physical Printing of the Books (June/July 2023):**\nJune 1-30, 2023: Print the NFT Yearbook.\n\n**Shipping (End of July 2023):**\nJuly 3-16, 2023: Prepare for shipping, including packaging and labeling.\nJuly 17, 2023: Open physical claim and begin shipping the NFT Yearbooks to customers.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1hTTPp43.jpg)\n\n\n## Budget Breakdown\n\n**The total budget for the NFT Yearbook project is 88.6815 ETH**\n\nHere's how it will be allocated:\n\n**Commission for NOUNS Limited Edition Cover:**\nA total of 3 ETH will be allocated for commissioning an artist, voted by NOUNS Prop House to create three different versions of the limited edition cover.\n\n**Production and Delivery of Books:** The rest of the funds, which total 88.6815 ETH, will be allocated to Metaverse Publishing for the production and delivery of the NFT Yearbooks. This allocation includes:\n- Printing and placing an additional 100 NOUNS Cover NFT Yearbooks in strategic locations, worldwide, starting with Harvard Business School.\n- Cost of producing the digital and physical versions of the NFT Yearbook with the limited edition NOUNS DAO cover.\n- Cost of delivery, which includes worldwide shipping and taxes.\n- The claim for the 6.9lbs physical coffee table book.\n\nThe allocation is based on the public mint price of the book (0.1195 ETH per book), multiplied by the total number of books (717 books).\n\nThe funds will be transferred to the Metaverse Publishing multisig Safe wallet.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJjV0w6Nh.jpg)\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe NFT Yearbook project is an innovative initiative to preserve and celebrate the vibrant, diverse, and rapidly evolving web3 community. By incorporating NOUNS DAO into this historical chronicle and funding the placement of 100 books in strategic libraries around the world, we are not only recognizing the significant role of the DAO and its members in shaping the web3 landscape, but we are also furthering our commitment to diversity, equality, inclusivity and building a community driven narrative of the amazing world of web3.\n\nThe proposed budget of 88.6815 ETH will enable the production and delivery of a limited edition NFT Yearbook featuring a unique NOUNS DAO cover, both in digital and physical formats and placing an additional 100 NOUNS NFT Yearbooks in strategic locations around the world. This endeavor will help NOUNS DAO to have a tangible and lasting impact, reaching up to 3,075 new homes worldwide, and even prestigious institutions like Harvard Business School.\n\nBy supporting this project, NOUNS DAO will contribute to an important historical project, while also paving the way for the future of publishing in the web3 space. The NFT Yearbook not only represents a snapshot of the current state of the NFT community, but it also serves as a vision of what the community can accomplish in the future.\n\nWe appreciate your consideration of this proposal and look forward to the opportunity of working with NOUNS DAO on this significant project.\n\n",

Here's some of the work I have done:\n\n- [Lil Nouns Music Video](https://twitter.com/ArashSlacker/status/1603321209613127680?s=20&t=7reei4hWvrg9tCth14J7MA) funded by Lil Nouns' [Content Pod](https://discord.com/channels/954142017556979752/1016388331602460773);\n- [Put Your Noggles On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnNIvVETNvY) Music video.\n- this [Shrimpy Noun in a Burger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e-3rIzsQWw) animation video;\n- this [I'm The Bomb animation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQjWXc2EHQk);\n- or this [Nounish GIPHY channel](https://giphy.com/channel/ArashNegahban/nounish) hosting a growing set of Nounish GIFs;\n- additionally, if you take a look at [my Twitter media](https://twitter.com/ArashSlacker/media), you will find even more Nounish animation content I have made in the past six months.\n\nI have extensive experience in creating animated musical and cute videos, and I'm confident that I can produce engaging content that will attract and entertain my audience. With my expertise in animation, modeling, music production, and singing, I'm well-equipped to deliver high-quality videos that are both visually stunning and sonically appealing. I understand what it takes to create a successful YouTube channel, and I'm excited to take on this challenge and grow my channel by consistently publishing new and exciting content. I'm passionate about creating animations that evoke emotion and connect with viewers, and I believe that my unique skills and creative vision can help me achieve this goal. I look forward to sharing my work with the world and building a community of fans and supporters.\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1NQNRgv2.png)](https://www.youtube.com/@NounishKids/videos)\n\n---\n\n**Budget:**\n\n\nPublish one animated educational music video every 7 days, which amounts to **4 videos per month**.\n\nEach video will be **1:30-5** minutes long and aimed at children.\n\nThe cost of each episode is estimated at **4000$** on average for each video.\n\nTo keep the channel going, it needs to be monetized and generate enough revenue to cover the cost of producing new videos and become self-sustainable. We estimate that we need **15 videos** to monetize the channel and should achieve self sustainability within **4 months**.\n\nTotal costs: **60,000 USDC**\n\n---",

The first event, held in 2022, was financed by the 5ETH Small Grant from Nouns DAO. Primarily successful in Japan, we're planning to host the second event in 2023. This year, we aim to expand globally and attract more participants than before. The main objectives of the festival include:\n\n- Spreading awareness about the importance of a peaceful and sustainable Earth\n- Materializing the \"Public Good\" concept, which is integral to Nouns' principles\n- Broadening Nouns' recognition to a wider audience\n\nIn this proposal, we request a budget of 47.1ETH to accomplish these goals. The details follow.\n\n## Table of Contents ⌐◨-◨\n- Introduction\n- Our Commitment to This Film Festival\n- Preparations for the 2023 Festival\n  - Establishing New Submission Categories\n  - Intensifying Call for Entries\n  - Implementing a Participatory Voting System\n  - Enhancing Screenings and Award Ceremonies\n- Schedule\n- Budget\n- NounsFes Originators\n- Appendix: Achievements from 2022\n\n## Introduction ⌐◨-◨\nNounsFes is an online art festival, conceived by the members of NounsDAO, aiming to educate as many people as possible about the importance of a peaceful and sustainable Earth. Our theme, \"The Importance of a Peaceful and Sustainable Earth,\" embodies the principle of \"Public Good,\" which Nouns values greatly. This year, we aim to invite diverse submissions and offer more people an opportunity to understand the ideals behind Nouns and NounsFes.\n\n## Our Commitment to This Film Festival ⌐◨-◨\nWhile film festivals like the Cannes Film Festival and the Academy Awards are renowned, they're bound by traditional business models, prompting us to perceive a need for a new type of film festival. Information transmission methods vary from text, text and images, sound, sound and images, to video. It is clear that video is the most efficient way to communicate information. We believe that there is a huge future potential in short videos viewed through small smartphone screens, given the inconvenience of VR/AR glasses, despite emerging concepts like \"virtual space\" or \"metaverse.\"\n\n## Preparations for the 2023 Festival ⌐◨-◨\nThe first event in 2022 allowed us to introduce the importance of a peaceful and sustainable Earth within Japan via NounsFes. However, we have not yet managed to relay this concept to many who are unaware of Nouns. Hence, this year, we aim to familiarize more people with NounsFes and further disseminate the importance of a peaceful and sustainable Earth, and the principle of \"Public Good\" that Nouns values.\n\nNounsFes Updates:\n- Establishing new submission categories\n- Intensifying call for entries\n- Implementing a participatory voting system\n- Enhancing screenings and award ceremonies\n\n### 1. Introduction of New Categories\nThis year, we aim to encourage more people to submit more works by introducing new categories such as Short Video, Vertical Short Video, and Super Short Video. The added categories are designed to be easily accessible to anyone using their smartphones.\n\n- **Short Video Category**\n    The aim is to create 2-3 minute works that evoke emotions and contribute to a better future. The themes are love, peace, or sustainable earth (SDGs).\n    Example work: [Theme SDGs](https://youtu.be/bQoJqDi8490)\n[![](https://img.youtube.com/vi/bQoJqDi8490/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQoJqDi8490)\n    \n\n- **Vertical Short Video Category**\n    With the same aim and themes as the Short Video Category, this category calls for works that fully utilize the verticality of smartphone-recorded daily life.\n[![](https://img.youtube.com/vi/77mNcy0D-NU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77mNcy0D-NU)\n\n- **Super Short Video Category**\n    This category calls for works under 60 seconds with the same aim and themes as above, focusing on capturing the viewer's heart in a short time.\n[![](https://img.youtube.com/vi/6sSjPzsFvPA/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sSjPzsFvPA)\n\n### 2. Strengthening the Collection of Works\nLast year, we received around 50 submissions. We are strengthening our efforts to attract more entries. The specific measures are as follows:\n1. Introduce new categories (Vertical Short Video and Super Short Video) to make it easier for more people to submit their works.\n2. Simplify the application process to ease the burden on applicants.\n3. Experiment with various new promotional activities.\n* Visit schools and directly approach students aspiring to be creators to encourage them to apply.\n* Conduct daily recruitment of submissions through official social media channels.\n* Renew the website and regularly update its content to attract more participants.\n* Run online commercials to generate interest and encourage applications from a wider audience.\n* Actively participate in various events and distribute leaflets to increase awareness.\n* Organize a press super-short video contest online to enhance visibility.\n* Collaborate with web3 influencers to become ambassadors and promote the event.\n* Implement various giveaway campaigns to generate interest and encourage participation.\n* Create mechanisms to provide real-time updates on application status and continue information dissemination.\n* Maintain ongoing communication and information dissemination to NounsDao and various Nouns sub-DAO members worldwide.\n* Utilize audio media and Twitter Spaces to regularly promote events and showcase submitted works. Specifically, collaborate with The NounSquare, a space hosted by pNouns every Friday, to disseminate information globally.\n\nThrough these publicity activities, ensure that the objectives of NounsFes are well-known and create an environment where many people submit their works.\n\n### 3. Establishing an All-Participation Voting System\nSubmitted works will be published on social media platforms (Youtube, TikTok) for review by participants with voting rights.\n\nLast year, we conducted voting using NFTs called \"Named Noun\" and \"Nouns Love\" from the collection as voting rights. This year, we will continue using these two NFTs as voting rights and further grant voting rights to NFT holders related to Nouns. This update aims to create a more accessible system for a larger number of people to participate in the voting process.\n\n### 4. Enrichment of Screening and Award Ceremonies\nThe award ceremony for outstanding works will be held after the screening. As before, we will host real events by renting a movie theater and invite the creators of the nominated works to walk the red carpet.\n\nFurthermore, at the venue, we will distribute/sell Nouns-related merchandise and conduct workshops to promote the various aspects of Nouns and enhance the excitement of the event. Many members of the Nouns proposal 228: NogglesJackTokyo are part of the project team this time. The event held on May 20-21, 2023, was a great success.\n\nHere are some examples of Nouns-related merchandise that were sold at that time.\n![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1030992113799798801/1117063446618456064/goods.jpg)\n\n\nThis is the movie of that time.\n{%youtube H2i0gGUXCnA %}\n\n\nThis time, we are accepting submissions from around the world. Attendance at the screening will be from various locations worldwide.\nFor those who cannot attend the venue on the day of the event, we aim to provide a virtual screening venue in metaverses or other virtual spaces, enabling a larger number of participants to join the screening.\n\n![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1030992113799798801/1117063447000121344/MetaVerse.jpg)\n\n## Schedule ⌐◨-◨ \n- Announcement : 2023/7/1 \n- Submission Period : 2023/7/10 - 11/30\n- Nominee Announcement : 2023/12/10 \n- Final Result Announcement (Screening) : 2023/12/21 (tentative) \n\n## Budget ⌐◨-◨\n### Project Expense Breakdown\n- Planning, Operation, Accounting : 3.8 ETH\n- Website Development : 7.5 ETH\n- Content Management : 4.2 ETH\n- PR Activities : 4.5 ETH\n- Event Expenses : 3.8 ETH\n150,000 yen (theater), Travel and transportation expenses 300,000 yen (awardees), 500,000 yen (others)\n- Gift Expenses : 1.3 ETH\n\n### Prize Money\n- *Total: 22.0 ETH*\n  - Short category: Best: 3 ETH x 1, Excellence: 2 ETH x 2, Honorable mention: 1 ETH x 3\n  - Vertical Short category: 0.5 ETH x 10 \n  - Super Short category: 0.5 ETH x 10\n  - PR Pre-contest: 0.1 ETH x 20\n\n### Total Budget: 47.1 ETH\n(Note: The requested amount for this proposal)\n\n## Organizer\n[**Satoshi Nakajima**](https://twitter.com/nounsfes) - Software architect of Windows95 and Founder of Xevo Inc.(Noun245 Owner)\n\n### Supported by:\n\n[**Singularity Society**](https://www.singularitysociety.org/) - An organization created to provide entrepreneurs who have the potential to shoulder the next era of Japan and the world with opportunities for study, discussion, information dissemination, networking, and entrepreneurship, and to support them in various ways.\n\n[**NounsDAO JAPAN**](https://twitter.com/NounsDAOJAPAN) - Japanese biggest community of Nouns.

We garnered [record support from the DAO](https://lilnouns.proplot.wtf/idea/529), as well as valuable feedback from many members that helped improve our prop. We look forward to supporting the Lils and being part of the community!_\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## TL;DR:\n\n* We are proposing to use our Matr Labs robotics to fabricate 1,001 Nouns on-demand from #0 to #1,000. Artmatr will develop custom software and hardware to pull off this feat, including an exclusive airdropped physical redemption token, MATRing portal with algorithmic and AI creative control, cutting edge tool development, and the extensive code development required to tie it all together. All Noun holders will have the right to customize and claim their respective physical copy(s).  \n* All shipping and handling costs to deliver the physical work to community members will be covered by Artmatr. We will create or employ a shipping system that ensures anonymity of any address information needed.\n* Complementary digital content, including timelapse videos and high-resolution photography, will be available to Nouns holders and the community, and the airdropped redemption tokens will update to display the MATRed Nouns upon completion.\n* We will produce a massive Nouniversary event at Artmatr’s gallery, showcasing some of the first MATRed Nouns with live MATRing throughout the day.\n* This project will add a significant amount of new value to existing Nouns mints, as well as upcoming auctions. The content created by each Noun’s MATRing process will be widely distributed and shared, elevating visibility of the innovative ways Nouns can be works of art IRL, and the Nouniversary will be an opportunity to showcase that! We will also allocate any secondary royalties of the Matr Labs x Nouns token to the Nouns treasury.\n[![UIUX-GIF-1.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/SRSqsxjZ/UIUX-GIF-1.gif)](https://postimg.cc/62mFbwrR)\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## Overview\n\nOur [last prop](https://nouns.wtf/vote/224) allowed Artmatr the opportunity to develop and create seven unique paintings of Nouns over the course of one week in March. Each day’s minted Noun was interpreted by our team of artists and engineers and “MATRed” on the same day as a 48” x 48” oil painting with our custom robotic hardware and code. The winner of each auction was given the rights to the corresponding painting. We celebrated the week of Nouns art with a successful public exhibition and VIP opening in our Brooklyn gallery, attended by major artists, gallerists, and auctioneers from the New York art scene.\n\nWe’re excited to follow up on the success of Prop 224 with a massive endeavor to bring physical art to every Nouner in the world. With the help of the Nouns community’s creative input, we propose to MATR 1,001 Nouns and distribute them globally to their respective holders. [Each Noun-holding wallet will be airdropped a Matr Labs token that can be redeemed for a physical. ](https://vimeo.com/830696167)We will update the metadata of the token upon redemption with a hi-res image of the Matr’d Noun, which will provide a digital Certificate of Authenticity for each physical piece of art. Supporting this huge development and production effort, we will deploy curated content across a variety of social channels, raising visibility of Nouns DAO and the ways Nouns create value and delight for the both broader Web3 community as well as the community of artists and art collectors that we are fostering.\n\nThis project aims to return on investment to the Nouns DAO in as many ways as possible, through high-quality content, marketing, and sponsorship visibility. We will publicly celebrate this endeavor with a huge launch party and exhibition near the August 8th Nouniversary and we will continue to promote this effort through dedicated social channels throughout the rest of the year and into 2024. We also propose that one of our cutting-edge MATR Labs machine racks gets built with custom Nouns sponsorship visibility, so that Noggles and Nouns branding can be seen in the content generated by every piece of art created on the machine. \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## Recap\n[![image6.png](https://i.postimg.cc/B6wL4HwZ/image6.png)](https://postimg.cc/njBc1jJN)\n\nProp 224 passed on February 13, 2023, to a resounding yes vote of 151 to 17. We immediately began developing ways we could use our custom robots and software to create a unique oil painting for each Noun over the prescribed week. We developed a number of stylistic directions that required new tools and hours of code development. Ultimately, we created paintings with unique robotically-created textures in the oil paint that brought dimensionality and life to Nouns, and embedded the mint hash into the paintings as well.\n\n[![image9.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/NF9yMFW6/image9.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/4HG42f4y)\n\nWe wrote thousands of lines of code to reinterpret the digital images as paintings, honed the tooling, mixed the paint, and arranged the cameras. As proposed, we completed a unique painting of that day’s Noun, on time, and live streamed the entire process, as well as a 3D scan of each finished work for our virtual gallery. The project pushed our technical limits to the edge and allowed us to try new creative techniques that have greatly improved our art-making processes as a whole.\n\n[![image17.png](https://i.postimg.cc/q71gx2rc/image17.png)](https://postimg.cc/Nyrgg95L)\n\nDuring production time our Twitter and Instagram feeds were full of Nouns as our content and marketing team came up with new and creative ways to showcase the community through the paintings. The project generated great buzz from the community, and generated auction prices above the previous 30-day average, including a 36.69 ETH sale on the genesis painting. The week was capped off with a successful [first-ever exhibition in the Artmatr space in Brooklyn](https://vimeo.com/829178232). The works have been seen and talked about by major collectors, artists, galleries and auction houses, including Christie’s, Pace, Pioneer Works, and many other VIP’s in the crypto and traditional art communities. \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n[![image3.png](https://i.postimg.cc/mrBFwbH4/image3.png)](https://postimg.cc/87X5kg4X)\n[![image11.png](https://i.postimg.cc/QtPtRsHH/image11.png)](https://postimg.cc/TLVfDzj6)\n[![image18.png](https://i.postimg.cc/wMmvzPmF/image18.png)](https://postimg.cc/RJv9QgGn)\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nSince the passing and success of our last Prop, Artmatr has grown significantly. We’ve scaled up, adding seasoned Project, Operations, and Product Managers, as well as building a dedicated 3 person marketing team. Our engineering team has also expanded, driving our hardware and software development at breakneck speeds. We held an exhibition opening with Zancan at our Brooklyn gallery space that 500 people attended, and other art from the Artmatr lab has been shown at Pace Gallery and Unit London, among other established galleries worldwide. Our Twitter following has more than doubled, and we engage with a diverse and growing audience across our popular Tik Tok, Instagram, Twitch, and Discord channels. Our organic reach has been very strong, maintaining an impressive 10.5% average engagement rate, with over 400k impressions in the period following the original Prop.\n\nWe learned specific lessons from the execution of our first proposal. The most important thing is that we want to prioritize total community engagement, both the whole Nouns community and our growing Web3-curious traditional art world community. By scaling down the final pieces and allowing anyone to MATR a Noun using a redemption token, we think this project will have a much broader impact. We also want to stress the effort that we plan to put into this project to raise visibility of the Nouns DAO through our social channels. We see each MATRed piece as an opportunity to spread the word about the creativity of the community and promote the brand, and our automated cameras will capture and produce a timelapse video of the MATRing process of each created work. We will also explore collaborative Nouns MATRing with our community of blue-chip artists.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## New Prop\n[![Untitled.png](https://i.postimg.cc/2SDp85Jn/Untitled.png)](https://postimg.cc/nC0S3nnL)\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nOur new Matr Labs platform consisting of newly developed art-making software and scaled down versions of our large machines will incorporate technology distilled from our experiences with the likes of Tyler Hobbs, Zancan and other brilliant artists we work with. The technology is entering a production-ready state from an initial prototype, and we want the Nouns community to work with us as we continue to develop and scale. We are committed to pushing the envelope of technological creativity, and with the assistance of Nouns DAO, we will help define the bridge between digital and physical artwork for a future generation of artists. \n\n[![image16.png](https://i.postimg.cc/Z0zq5cPm/image16.png)](https://postimg.cc/D45hC1Yp)\n\nWe would like to propose that every Noun holder from #0 to #1000 will have the opportunity to use our new platform and generate a unique 18” x 18” unique physical rendition of a Noun (their own, another from the collection, or a new noun from the Playground). Each MATRed Noun will be shipped to the holder at no additional cost, worldwide. \n\n[![image12.png](https://i.postimg.cc/MHCnjxSh/image12.png)](https://postimg.cc/ctcxVp6m)\n\n_User flow: User starts by connecting their wallet & choosing their Noun on the server > Personalizes the Noun > server generated a preview with the translation layer > users has three choices: Modify the artwork, Save the preview for consideration or send to MATR > during the MATRing process, the work is captured in high res and when the MATR process is finished, the work is minted and shipped._\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nThe key to MATRing a physical Noun will be the 1,0001 redemption tokens, which will be airdropped to all wallets holding Nouns and will continue to be distributed as new Nouns are minted and won - up to #1,000. In the spirit of Noun’s CC0 license, a redemption token holder will be able to use any Noun in the collection as inspiration for their physical. The tokens can also be traded in the event that a holder does not want a physical, and royalties will be sent to the treasury.\n\n[![](https://i.postimg.cc/PxwJnx90/Group-10.png)](https://vimeo.com/830696167)\n\nThe physical pieces created by the Nouns community and anyone outside who acquires a redemption token will generate increased visibility and value to the DAO, as existing holders and new auction winners alike will be given the opportunity to create a physical representation of their Noun with their own creative input. This creates both physical permanence for the Nouns in the world, as well as the possibility for virality for every related social media post that is shared. Additionally, we will also brand our newly-produced robot with Nouns branding, elevating Nouns visibility alongside the growth of this initiative. This machine will get heavy use, with time lapses and photos being core to the creation process, so the Nouns will be visually associated with the works created by incredible artists using the same tech.\n\n[![image4.png](https://i.postimg.cc/qvdtJkQK/image4.png)](https://postimg.cc/VdDs4Pxs)\n*_Concept of Nouns Sponsored Matr Labs Rack_*\n\nHaving the Nouns community with us will give us the freedom to come up with exciting new ways to implement our technology that we may not otherwise have been able to do when operating within the constraints of an individual artist. We want to continue pushing the boundaries of our technology in order to make art that excites both the Nouns community and our community at-large.\n[![image13.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/k4DG1DM0/image13.gif)](https://postimg.cc/mzfThLHj)\nWe are eager to develop and employ our new tech at the epic scale that it was built for. We went big with this project, and want the community to feel that their money is well spent. It is easy to quantify the project on a per-print cost basis, but do keep in mind that we are also committing to a constant stream of content, marketing, and PR on behalf of the Nouns DAO, an epic NYC event as part of the Nouniversary celebrations, and development of a new Matr Labs robot that will be Nouns sponsored and branded. We feel that these intangibles will bring a lot of value and visibility to the community, while allowing us the opportunity to build the tech to its full potential in a shortened period of  time. \n[![image10.png](https://i.postimg.cc/GmJ49ZS5/image10.png)](https://postimg.cc/MnH6Frw7)\n[![image14.png](https://i.postimg.cc/T2pt8XkG/image14.png)](https://postimg.cc/rz21W7XY)\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n## Timeline & Milestones\n\n* Immediately following the acceptance of the proposal, Artmatr will begin development of a custom Nouns DAO creative interface and the construction of a Nouns-sponsored Matr Labs rack. We will open up private social channels on Discord and provide regular updates on the progress made on both the hardware and software development. We will stay active in those channels for enthusiasts of the technology to engage with our team of artists and engineers and also promote the project development publicly via our Twitter & Instagram. \n* Artmatr will use the community Nouns as our test materials during the summer development process, and will publish the results as the works are formed.\n* Near the public launch of the Matr portal, we will airdrop Matr Labs x Nouns redemption tokens to all wallets holding Nouns. We will continue to distribute those tokens to new holders up to #1,000.\n* We will officially launch the token-gated Nouns website for the community to start generating works using the Nouns on August 1. Shortly thereafter, we will host a live gallery event at Artmatr in NYC near the August 8th Nouniversary. We will exhibit the community Nouns created by Artmatr at the event, and allow Nouns holders the ability to create their work live that day.\n* The community-exclusive MATRing will remain active until January 31, allowing the community to create unique works of art from the Nouns that they hold in their wallets, utilizing a specialized UI which includes a number of AI and algorithmic features. Noun holders will be able to customize their Noun to create a unique work of art using pens, brushes, and our proprietary painting tools, MATRed on acid-free, archival grade 100 lb Bristol cardstock. The works will be shipped to each community member as they are made free of charge.\n* Timelapse video and hi-rez photos of each work will be collected and collated by our automated systems, and will be used to generate additional visibility of the project via dedicated Twitter and Discord channels. The content will also be available on our website, and used to update the metadata of the redemption tokens, transforming the airdrop into a new collection of MATRed Nouns.\n* We commit to doing everything we can to ensure the anonymity of the Nouns DAO community. We are closely aligned with a number of other cryptoart companies who have been working to address this issue (Artfora, for example) and we are working with them on solutions. We are exploring address escrow services, secure databases that automatically delete information after use, and other methods. We want to work with the community in a variety of ways to ensure as many people have access to physical prints as possible and would post instructions on how to address a package to a UPS store or PO Box for additional anonymization.\n\n[![image8.png](https://i.postimg.cc/63Q2kYc1/image8.png)](https://postimg.cc/HJfk50fQ)\n\n[![table2.png](https://i.postimg.cc/zfMYNk1G/table2.png)](https://postimg.cc/bGQBHkJ7)\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## About\n\nArtmatr’s team of experts from the art, robotics, Web3, and marketing worlds are focused on broadly expanding every artists’ creative toolkit. We want to make our highly sophisticated hardware and software technologies available to everyone, from the biggest names in art to an emerging creative at home. We have so far demonstrated our ability to execute bespoke projects at a small scale, and now we are ready to start opening the doors to the world at-large. \n\nLed by CEO Rafael Feitelberg and CCO Ben Tritt, Artmatr’s creative studio in Brooklyn and R&D lab in Israel are developing revolutionary art-making tools and techniques. Our Brooklyn studio has a steady stream of artists coming in with brand new creative ideas unlocked thanks to our expanding technology. This tech platform is a significant part of our future development pipeline with the artists, platforms and galleries that we are working with. We also are developing ways for the public to access this tech and “Matr” their own custom creations. We have plans to scale this product to democratize the creation of physical artwork. In the medium term, it will allow us to have a sustainable solution for artists to work on ideas that may be higher volume and more accessible to a larger collector base. Having Nouns DAO as our development sponsor will accelerate our timeline and product viability for artists to start using it. We think this will be one of our marquee tools, and Nouns will cement themselves in the art community with the legacy and visibility of being the first to use it.\n\nSince our launch mid-2022, we have had successful projects with Tyler Hobbs, Zancan, Matthew Stone and Matthew Day Jackson, and our 2023 pipeline is full of exciting projects with blue-chip and emerging artists alike.\n\nArtmatr’s Investors & Strategic Partners:\n\n\n* [Delphi Digital](https://delphidigital.io): Delphi Digital is the leading research organization for crypto assets.

I think we stand to benefit from explicitly approaching this. Lets try to actually learn some lessons in the grand virtuous cycle experiment.\n\nIn the previous prop past art was referenced as selling for more than 250k, yet the pieces from Prop 224 did not raise auction prices by anywhere close to that. We did not move the needle on auction prices as planned, there was a disconnect.\n\nBut - they did a few things right. They raised auction prices in a way that was clearly attributed to their efforts, meaning they effectively caught people's attention and converted this into bids, proving that the approach is a possibility. They earned genuine enthusiasm from a number of Nouners during the week, I enjoyed their posts on twitter, the events they held, and this video: https://vimeo.com/829178232.\n\nI think it makes sense to readjust and try again, and they have. This proposal offers 1001 physical pieces at a significantly lower per-piece cost to the DAO. On top of this, and most importantly, this is paired with 10 months of marketing, comms, and events. \n\nI am in favour of this proposal. For it to be considered a success, and receive further funding, we need to see a sustained increase in average auction price. If it increases by about 1 ETH over the next 264 days we break even.\n\nIf this passes I hope the team puts serious effort into drawing attention to their art and the daily Nouns auction.

It can be said that Web3 has not yet penetrated the general public. Naturally, even fewer people know about nouns.\n\nHowever, due to the growth of the blockchain field and the fact that nouns and Noggles are IPs using CC0We imagine that nouns and Noggles will gradually penetrate the market and become a commonplace part of society in the future.\nThis is the timeline we are aiming for and realizing, we believe that participating in the Web3 Conference is very meaningful.\n\n\n## Concept\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**“ Mirai ” means Future.**\n\n\n〜The future of nouns and noggles in Japan.  \n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　A place to showcase such a future, one step ahead〜\n\n\n![田川さんのコンセプトアート](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=17MZIZqPcUGiz_xfOsM7sJg34HF0VqjsG)\n\n**Key visual　”Pop Pop Tokyo”**\n\n\n*PROLOGUE*\n*Nounsdao is a new organization called dao, built by web3 technology, with the philosophy of making the world more enjoyable through character and art.*\n\n*The activities of dao are helping to integrate nouns among people around the world and create the beloved Mirai.

We will introduce the future of the fusion of nouns and Japan to visitors using the spirit of harmony (exhibition), art (live painting), and metaverse (technology).\n\n\n## Key Points\n\nNouns characters and Noggles will blend naturally with Tatami mats and Japanese culture, showing the futuristic fun of mixed culture.\n\nWe will set up a unique and different Japanese-style room in the business conference space to provide visitors with the experience of taking off their shoes and sitting on tatami mats.\n\nIn the Tatami room, noggle type VR glasses will be provided. Each guest will be guided to Nouns street in Co-Mati, a Japanese-style space in the Metaverse Spatial space, using their own smartphone. Various real and virtual hospitality related to Nouns will be offered here.\n\n\n\n## “Noren” and “Tea room” that invite you to Mirai\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n![茶室と暖簾の絵](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1-lnd16j4m-dZbNEcswOCfmM7yhktCRgn)\n\n\n〜The spirit of Japanese hospitality \"Teahouse\" and the sense of anticipation after passing through the \"noren\" curtain.This \"tearoom\" is used as a \"portal\" to connect to Nouns' Mirai = \"Future\".\n\nJapanese hospitality is based on the spirit of \"tea ceremony,\" a form of hospitality that is appropriate to not be pretentious\nThe \"noren\" (traditional Japanese curtains) hanging in front of stores in Japan are not only used as signboards, but are also used to show the store's credibility and pride. Such a uniquely Japanese interior is expressed in a small space of 3m✖️3m.\n\nVisitors pass through the noren (curtain) and are invited to enter a small but isolated Japanese space with tatami mats. In this small space, we commissioned a master craftsman and a noren workshop to create a small Japanese room that can be incorporated into modern life, creating an interior that makes the most of the small space.\n\n\n\n## Live Painting -Drawing Mirai on a pure white campus\n---\n\n\n![田川さんの制作写真](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1RbpKX_psTCrz5T4Qy-_B3-SolAl5fpIV)\n\n\n[🔗Live painting activity video by Mr. Tagawa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xU1USuJtVLU) \n\n\n\nAt the booth, a live painting event will be held, where Makoto Tagawa, a painter, will create a key visual of NounsMiraiJAPAN from scratch on a pure white wall of 2.7m✖️3.0m. What kind of work (future) will it be? Might it be different from the \"PopPopTokyo\" work shown at the beginning of the exhibition?

Almost half the budget is going to WebX.\n\nI think some aspects of this are really cool, I like the Pop Pop Tokyo visual a lot and the team room is interesting. But there's a lot packed in here and it feels a little unfocused. I'm not super excited about metaverse/VR stuff. \n\nI would rather fund some standalone Nouns event or activation. Hope we can find more ways to support Nouns Japan. Thanks again!  ",

      "description": "# Nouns Display Font\n\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJ4YIVpSn.png)](https://marcokane.com/nouns_display.mp4)\n[Watch promo video](https://marcokane.com/nouns_display.mp4)\n\n    \n## TLDR\nWhy don’t we have a proper Nounish display font? Let’s make one that everybody can use. Recognizable, fun, CC0. For Nouns projects, products and beyond. \nRequesting 18 eth. \n\n### See the draft letter drawings in use: [nounsfonts.wtf](https://nounsfonts.wtf)\n\n## WHY\nOn websites, videos, gear, and other items, the display typeface a user sees is one of the most critical aspects of visual recognition. \n    \nA display typeface performs numerous functions like an oft-needed guide for a weary traveler. It reassures users, gives them a good feeling, creates understanding, and establishes direction. Of all the typefaces used in Nouns materials–outside of Nountown–none feel particularly Nounish. This is because there aren’t any genuinely Nounish display fonts available for use. We aim to solve that–Nouners need more tools for their evergrowing toolbox to help spread the lore of Nouns.\n    \nThe [Nountown](https://nouns.center/assets) typeface is inspiring. Picking up where Gremplin left off, I propose creating a unique, beautiful, functional Nounish display typeface with a CC0 license available for general use. We use CC0, so this font can be a starting point for a whole suite of open-source Nounish fonts, bolstering the ecosystem visually. **Nouns Display is a font L1 that many L2s can be built on. Eg., Nouns Display and lil nouns display.**\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1_CqbhBn.png)\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1Xaobnr2.png)\n   \nThanks to the generous support of our [prop house proposal](https://prop.house/proposal/5071) we have a start. The initial sketches, and process can be seen on our microsite [nounsfonts.wtf ](https://nounsfonts.wtf)\n\nThis proposal allows us to finish a full-featured CCO typeface that everyone can use on nouns projects, products, and beyond.\n\n    \n## GETTING IT OUT THERE\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJCC9AsH3.jpg)\n\nWe will produce a limited run of distinctly tasteful gear featuring the typeface upon launch.\n\nWe will submit Nouns Display for inclusion in the Google Fonts catalogue for wide distribution and easy use in Figma. \n    \nIt will be used on [Zora’s new profiles pages](https://zora.co/profiles). \n    \nWe will structure a Zora-based NFT launch when the typeface is complete. **Nouns Display would be the first NFT of a usable production typeface, effectively disrupting the typeface industry with NFTs and opening up a new paradigm for fonts as financial assets.**\n\n\n## WHO\nI am Marco Braunschweiler, a designer with a background in art, and I make typefaces that I use everyday. I’ve worked with Tribute Labs, The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, Acura, Sonos, The New York Times, and NTS Radio.\n\nMy fonts are here: [m-a-r-c-o.com/typefaces](https://m-a-r-c-o.com/typefaces)\nMy design studio is here: [openwindow.studio](https://openwindow.studio)\n\n\n## ROADMAP\nPhase 1 is complete. This proposal is for phases 2, and 3. Requesting 18 ETH.\n\n**Phase One – Complete**\n*Initial Sketches of Uppercase Letterforms*\nWe want to make sure we’re getting it right and creating something everyone loves; in this phase, we’ve done the research and made sketches for the initial letters, uppercase A–Z. Results are viewable at [nounsfonts.wtf](https://nounsfonts.wtf).\n\n\n**Phase Two – Up Next**\n*Drawing all Latin Glyphs*\nNow that research is done and a direction is established, we draw all the uppercase and lowercase Latin glyphs. At the end of this phase, we will have drawings of all the characters used. We will work with Nounish designers to test the typeface and collect feedback.\n\n    \n**Phase Three – Finish Line**\n*Updates, Revision, Mastering*\nThe finish line. We work to refine the typeface and master it for use across platforms. At the end of this phase, we have the final files that anyone can use to make their projects, and the world, look a bit more Nounish.\n\n    \n**Spec Sheet**\nFinal typeface will be ready for wide-use, and will include the following:\n* CC0 License\n* Mastering\n* Hinting\n* Unicode data normalization\n* Opentype feature checks\n* Metrics normalization/optimisation for desktop, mobile, and web environments\n* Generating final desktop and webfont files in: OTF, TTF, WOFF, WOFF2\n* Submission to Google Fonts \n        \n\n### Thank you for reading, and for your consideration.",

I propose to fund the development of credit card-sized computers that would be ideal for Ethereum staking.\n\nNounsDAO's commitment to making individual staking fun and popular would be a net plus for the whole network and ecosystem's well-being.\n\nIn my opinion, focusing on the public good would increase the recognition and respect for NounsDAO, which is the best strategy for proliferation.\n\n## Description\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rk8iWv2H3.gif)\n\nA lot of good single-board computers are available on the market, and the competition is stiff. However, the purpose of Noun Computers is not to dominate the market or make good profits. It is about a mission to do public good and unite like-minded developers, which will propel the nounish culture and memes. Of course, the key to success is a sustainable model. I believe Noun Computers will be successful because NounsDAO has an amazing culture, a better understanding of community, and connections in the blockchain circles. \n\nI propose the development of Noun Computers, which would run Linux operating system. These computers would be designed specifically for convenient Ethereum stacking, blockchain development, and practical programming learning. By doing so, we can establish a vibrant community of software and hardware developers who will eventually become good supporters and contributors to NounsDAO.\n\nJust imagine, the next thousand ethereum stakers (potential nouners) are mingling somewhere at blockchain conferences at this very moment! A cool gadget like Noun Computer would make for a great conversation starter. It has the potential to attract the attention of numerous high-profile individuals. We will be able to onboard many people to buy our Noun Computers and run Ethereum nodes.\n\n## Noun Computers\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1k5pljSn.png)\n\nNoun Computers will provide affordability, versatility, and the best price/performance/user experience within its category. I will design the Noun Computers from scratch. I majored in electrical engineering and computer science and have experience developing similar computer boards. Noun computers will be perfectly suited for running Ethereum nodes, software/hardware hacking, and teaching programming. \n\nOnce the project is completed, I will deliver PCB designs, blueprints, bill of materials, and estimated costs for mass production. In the future, NounsDAO will have the ability to order large batches of computers at wholesale prices. Additionally, we can develop expansion modules, interesting interfaces, and manufacture nounish cases to further enhance the product line.\n\nIn this project, I will focus on developing state of the art prototypes and estimating manufacturing cost. The limited supply of 50 prototypes will be used to create visibility and promote NounsDAO at conferences.\n\n- A Noun Computer equipped with a 1.5GHz CPU, 8GB RAM, and a 2TB M.2 SSD for running an Ethereum node will cost around $80 to $110.\n- A light version of Noun Computer with less memory can cost as low as $50\n- If there is significant demand and Noun Computers are produced in large quantities (3,000-5,000 units), the manufacturing cost can be further lowered, making Noun Computers a sustainable model for proliferation. The proceeds from sales could then be utilized to manufacture more computers and introduce additional accessories.\n\n## Deliverables\n- Design blueprints, schematics, and a plan for mass production of Noun Computers\n- 50 units of Noun Computer prototypes with aluminum head-crt-bsod case\n    - 10 units - distributed to Nouns' auction winners (starting with the first auction on the opening day of ETH Global NY or Istanbul)\n    - 10 units - showcase and distribute at conferences\n    - 30 units - organize ETH Global Hackathon competition centered around Noun Computers\n\n## Timeline\n**Phase I - Prototyping (4~6 months)**\n- [Jun~Aug 2023] Design and Manufacture Noun-Computer prototypes\n- [Sep or Nov 2023] Bring Noun Computers to ETH Global hackathon and organize hacking competition\n\n## Outsourcing companies\nI have many years of experience working with two great companies KS Technology and Hansaem digitec.\n- KS Technology https://altium.kr/\n- Hansaem digitec https://www.hsdgt.com/main/main.html\n\n## Future opportunities\n- **[Proliferation]** We can **sponsor ETH hackathons** and supply Noun Computers for hardware hackathons. Expansion modules such as camera, NFC, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS, and others would open doors for new, fun, and practical blockchain applications. In the long term, we can grow a community of developers around Noun Computers.\n- **[Onboarding]** We can manufacture Noun Computers in large quantities and offer them at affordable prices. By doing so, we could **onboard the Ethereum community** and encourage their contribution to the decentralization of the Ethereum network by **running Ethereum nodes**.\n- **[Public Good]** We can **allocate 20%~30%** of the future supply of Noun Computers to NounsDAO Public Good Fund. Nouners will be able to request computers via an on-chain proposal and send them to **developing countries and minority groups**. Noun Computers can be used to teach practical programming at schools and universities. It is a good way to put resources into the hands of people.\n\n## Person In Charge\nTwitter: [fiveoceans_dev](https://twitter.com/fiveoceans_dev)\nHey!

Noun40 and Jihad both have thoughtful points here that we should pay attention to. At the same time, I believe that the value of a gathering place around hardware outweighs the downsides of the use case and the market.\n\nHardware hackers are a very public goods oriented community that is filled with hobbyists.

I am voting for because I think this could turn into something exciting and I think the flow of funds, starting with funding to build out a proof of concept, makes sense and is a reasonable guard. \n\nIt looks like this is not going to pass, so I'll just note some ideas\n- Could we first fund an exploration to build a proof of concept machine? I think people will be excited by some proof they can see. \n- Are we sure that going for a validator is the best simplification of the original prop (281)? I really liked the original prop's focus on hobbyists and learning. This feels Nounish. Is there a way we can push in this direction at a lower cost? Again, just a proof of concept people can get excited about? \n- Nounish design is cool, but where can we gain the most from your expertise? Are there any huge pain points we can solve since we'll be going 0 to 1? It feels like a lot of the work for a validator may be redundant? \n- In general, I'd say don't hesitate to discuss with any and all Nouners to find the most exciting version of this, and then make sure to pitch that here. E.g. for this prop I think this may have amounted to one of the cheaaper validator options on the market, but this aspect wasn't really pitched. \n\nI appreciate fiveoceans sticking with this and trying to refine to arrive at something the DAO will support.

It serves as the central repository for storing and displaying all data such as ;\n\n* proposal progress images/videos\n* end product images/videos/links/repo\n* nounish artworks from contents & events\n* cc0 contents & working files\n\nThere is so much great Nouns content scattered across different platforms that went by everyday in our ecosystem. We aim to solve this by providing a central platform where all Nouns-related content all in one place and make it easier for everyone to find it.\n\n**In the past 4 months we have ;**\n\n1. [Archives.wtf](https://archives.wtf/) - built a reliable archive website from the ground up\n2. Built features ; [link to thread](https://twitter.com/thevoadz/status/1641034993798467593?s=20)\n* under any categories, you can search any related data within the page, eg ; **Nouns On-chain Proposal**\n    * prop number\n    * project title\n    * description\n    * builders/artists\n    * category\n* we enable **scroll, filter & search persistence** for better user navigation ( which stored on your device )\n* you can use **cmd+k / ctrl+k** for quick access to search in page\n* cc0 icon & download button\n3. As per 4/11/2023, we have gathered and archived ;\n* [Proposals](https://archives.wtf/props) ([On-chain](https://archives.wtf/props/onchain), [Prop House](https://archives.wtf/props/prop-house) & [NSFW](https://archives.wtf/props/nsfw-small-grants)) ; **611 proposals, 410 builders**\n* Contests by [Noun Square](https://archives.wtf/special), [4156](https://archives.wtf/nouns), [Gnars DAO](https://archives.wtf/subdao/gnars-dao), [Noadz](https://archives.wtf/noggles/noggles-art-contest) ; **606 artworks & entries, 326 artists**\n    * Nouniversary\n    * Nouns Holiday\n    * Nouns Mash-up\n    * Nouns Movies\n    * Nouns Sneakers\n    * Nouns Esports\n    * Nouns Space\n    * 100 Days of Nouns\n\n4. Total No of Builders - [Link](https://voadz.notion.site/ca874dfc6bff42eb9ae48e1af51d9258?v=3ef4593de67d487b9f50c625c7e46de2)\n5. Built a tool named [Uploadr](https://uploadr.app/) for quick data upload & storage to the Arweave network\n6. Organized & compiled full database in [Nouns Archive's Notion](https://voadz.notion.site/Nouns-Archive-da52f93301dd4ed59e5b876bd5151d93)\n\n**Feedbacks from the communities**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Rzlefqe.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7JC7JYU.png)\n\n**Feedbacks from Prop 270 *(defeated)***\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HGDC1cv.jpg)\n\n---\n\n## **3. Project Goals For Upcoming 6 Months**\n\n### **Why should we fund this extension?**\n\n* We want to assist Nouns community, particularly builders and artists, to be able to contribute their project materials and outputs via the platform, which serves as the primary archive centre for the Nouns ecosystem that can be a good reference to others & later generations.\n* It'd be one of the main onboarding tools that keeps track of everything that has occurred in Nouns DAO.\n* We anticipate that the platform will inspire more builders & artists to produce remarkable & high-quality content.\n* We believe that by developing a good proliferation strategies, complementary features & tools that cater the target audience could bring great values, increase targeted KPIs & enhance the product market fit of this project.\n* We will produce profit-oriented products that generates revenue back to the DAO's treasury.\n\n### **Strategy Summary**\n\n1. **Website Enhancement & Features**\n    * **CC0 media page**\n        * pinterest-like\n        * search & filter by type\n        * downloadable\n    * **Community archive submission**\n        * submit project/content outputs\n        * based on category/entirely new\n        * submission history\n    * **Permanent storage media uploader**\n        * free for nounish builders & Nouns-related NFT holders (token-gated)\n        * upload history\n    * **Archivist/builder leaderboard**\n        * gamification\n    * **Feed**\n        * RSS & Atom XML\n        * JSON (Public API)\n\n2. **Proliferation**\n    * **Publications**\n        * kickstart Nouns Archive '23 (sample physical book)\n        * produce monthly Nouns Zine (digital & physical)\n        * convert to profit oriented product\n        * proceeds goes to DAO\n        * quarterly wrap-up report\n    * **Brand Awareness**\n        * prop house round ; Nouns Archive\n        * new feature updates on social media\n        * daily props curation/highlights\n        * ads & campaign (gamified)\n\n3. **Maintenance & Sustainability**\n    * **General website maintenance**\n        * enhance better ui/ux\n    * **Data curation & updates**\n        * data > filter > curate > present\n        * daily updates\n    * **Incentivise submission through leaderboard**\n        * community submission\n\n### **Strategy Details**\n\n**For Website Enhancement & Features ;**\n\n**1. Community archive submission**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EKvVcFO.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zRGCmYR.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kYzeI8v.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AUrMjNR.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1rQXaEQ.png)\n\n* To build **a curated submission form** attached to the website which allows anyone to contribute to the platform.\n* Users are required for wallet connect (NNS supported) and could request to submit a new sub-category and additional contents to their existing proposals/details.\n* The forms will allow users to select their preferred category, status, type of house, round, etc. *(based on specific usage)*\n* User can check their submission history together with submission details *(eg; date, title & status)*\n\n**2. Permanent storage media uploader**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gVzs6Ih.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IoUQQkb.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KFIzROZ.png)\n\n* To improvise an [uploader](https://uploadr.app/) with some new features which we have built for the past few months.\n* Users are required for wallet connect (NNS supported) & it will be token gated focusing on Nouns ecosystem to use it for free ;\n    * Nounders\n    * Nouners\n    * Nounish Builders\n    * Sub DAOs\n    * Nouns' NFT Open Edition Holders / Droposals *(This Is Nouns, The Wizard's Hat etc)*\n* Anyone who has just got noun-pilled into the ecosystem and want to use it, they may choose from any of the available criteria above. This will gradually benefit the Nouns DAO ecosystem over time.\n* User can check their upload history together with the details *(eg; date, title & arweave link)*\n\n**3. Archivist/Contributor Leaderboard**\n\n* We want to create archivist/contributor leaderboard with gamification where top contributors will be incentivised.\n* We will use the fund under **OpEx** in ***Budget***.\n\n**4. Feed**\n\nUtilising a simplified and condensed data feed can be more efficient than navigating through an entire website for the required information, making data feed crucial for individual use cases. That is why we're adding feed as a new feature, to make it easier for you to access the data you need and achieve your goals more efficiently.\n\nWe will provide a few types of feed for the main & sub-category pages ;\n  * RSS feed - /rss.xml\n  * Atom  feed - /atom.xml\n  * JSON feed - /feed.json\n\nThe data we have gathered can be utilised by everyone in the ecosystem for their own unique purposes. For instance, a mini companion app can directly use the JSON feed to list all proposals in NSFW Small Grants.\n\n**For Proliferation Plan ;**\n\n**1. Publications - Nouns Archive '23**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oDnnmMN.png)\n\n* We will produce a yearly curated physical book that features the archive's contents.\n* It would be a completed & working sample physical book which does not include mass production.\n* The prop house round winner's design will be featured as the book's cover. *(more details below)*\n* We will kickstart the pre-production of the book in June 2023.\n* All builders and artists will be contacted to obtain permission to use their works inside the book *(unless CC0)*\n* Anyone who wishes to contribute can do so as we will communicate the deadline for submitting materials.\n* We will make it available for pre-order/mint. Holders will need to redeem for a physical piece.\n* All **profits** goes to the Nouns DAO's treasury.\n* We are not taking any compensation due to already been funded by the DAO.\n* More infos regarding the launch will be announced.\n\n**2. Nouns Zines**\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ry1WxY_N3.png)\n\n* We will produce a monthly curated zine that features great contents from Nouns ecosystem.\n* We believe that the focus of the first few issues contents should emphasise on onboarding more people towards Nouns and showing the most notable accomplishment from the first year of Nouns and on-going projects *(eg; Noundry, SuperBowl, Nouns Vision, TSP, Nouns Mural etc)*\n* The prop house round winner's design will be featured as the zine's cover. *(more details below)*\n* We will make it available for pre-order/mint & preview. Holders can also redeem for a physical piece *(the cost of shipping is borne by the holder)*\n* All **profits** goes to the Nouns DAO's treasury.\n* We are not taking any compensation due to already been funded by the DAO.\n* More infos regarding the launch will be announced.\n\n**3. Prop House Round - Nouns Archive**\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1zSnoUEn.png)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJgXjsUN2.png)\n*(Framework flow for each month)*\n\n* We will be producing two type of publications ; Nouns Zine & Nouns Archive '23.\n* We are looking at hosting our own prop house round, Nouns Archive. We will organize a few CC0 contests, with the selected winners being featured on the cover page & contents for Zine 01-05 & Nouns Archive '23.\n* Upon approval, we will start our first prop house round in June 2023.\n* There will be **six rounds** in total, 5 rounds for Nouns Zine & 1 round for Nouns Archive '23.\n* For each round, there will be ;\n    * 3 winners with a prize pool of **0.45E** *(1st/0.2E, 2nd/0.15E & 3rd/0.1E)*\n    * artwork of the **first-place winner** will be minted as open edition & to be featured as the zine cover of that month\n    * artworks of the **second & third-place winner** will be featured in the zine of that month\n    * **60%** of the proceeds goes to the DAO's treasury, **20%** goes to the artist & **20%** goes to Nouns Archive \n    * we will use **20%** of the proceeds to Nouns Archive to enhance the prize pool for future contests / add contest rounds / zine production etc\n    * for each round, it will be 3 weeks of submission period & 1 week of voting period\n    * Nouns ecosystem/holders are eligible to vote for the round. More infos will be announced\n\n**For Maintenance & Sustainability ;**\n\n**1. Data Permanence & Sustainability**\n\n* All compiled datas are stored in [Nouns Archive's notion](https://voadz.notion.site/Nouns-Archive-da52f93301dd4ed59e5b876bd5151d93).\n* We are using **Arweave** network to store all the datas due to its one time fee permanent storage and we want to use it exclusively for all storage going forward.\n* Currently, around **40%** of the datas are now saved on Arweave, with the remaining **60%** being processed. *(Currently on Notion)*\n* There have been a few instances where artists or builders have discontinued their hosting and lost their tracks; this is something we do not want to happen again.\n* We want to make sure all datas of Nouns ecosystem are permanently stored in a decentralised manner and is always accessible.\n* We are able to boost the website's performance with the help of **Vercel Edge Network** which offers image optimization, page load speed & automatically data cached on the network.\n* The cost of uploading will be factor in under **OpEx** as per attached in ***Budget***.\n\n**2. Checklist** *( to be archived )*\n\n* SubDAOs\n* Nouns' POAP Art (TNS, Nouncil & more)\n* [Nouns Museum](https://twitter.com/thenounsmuseum)\n* [InternatioNouns](https://twitter.com/InternatioNouns)\n* Nouns AI's Contest\n* Messhup's Cover Art\n* Prop House (Other houses, eg ; [Lil Nouns](https://prop.house/lil-nouns), [Nouns Japan](https://prop.house/nouns-japan), [Nouns Builder](https://prop.house/builder) etc)\n* Nouns On-Chain Props\n* NSFW\n* The Noun Square\n* Nouns World\n\n**3.

          "reason": "I really enjoy archives.wtf and have sent the link out many times. Am I the only one who has actually used this site? It's great! There's an overwhelming amount of Nouns art on here and communicates a broad sense of Nouns and Nounish aesthetic. It's currently my 2nd favorite reference to send artists for research, second only to the actual Nouns DAO playground.\n\nIf Nouns is going to last forever, shouldn't we be archiving everything?\n\nI would be happy to fund this as is, but it doesn't look like it will pass. In the next iteration of this prop I would like to see the following:\n\n1. A continued focus on CC0. The art is all interesting, mostly for skimming though. I can actually use the CC0 content! I can put it in videos, art, put it on a shirt. The more this focuses on CC0 media the more it enables and encourages viral permissionless growth of Nouns.\n\n2. The Nouns DAO on-chain proposals section needs to be fleshed out more, and could also be a serious justification for this project. Each funded DAO proposal should have a ton of meta-media. Behind the scenes shots, interviews with the proposer, images from the on-chain prop, screenshots and screen recordings of anything digital. Currently most props have 1-4 images and it doesn't feel comprehensive. Work with the prop submitters and teams to really get a thorough pile of media from them.\n\n3. Better top-level organization of content. I don't really understand the difference between NOUNS SPECIAL and NOUNS WORLD and NOUNS on the front page - it should be way more intuitive. Each item on the front page needs to be essential and obvious.\n\n4. This prop is probably too focused on the design and tech. It looks beautiful, and the arweave uploader is cool, but I think the focus really needs to be on usability, figuring out exactly what needs this fulfills, and on the content itself.\n\nI know on-chain rejections are challenging, but I encourage this team to workshop the proposal one more time and submit again. There is high quality work being done here and I would like to see it continued.",

          "reason": "My thesis as a delegate is: “Nouns has a unique role in the ecosystem as a gathering place around public goods.”\n\nI understand the debates on both sides — that archiving is a valuable public good, but that there may not be enough demand for it. I also understand that, since there was prior funding, the DAO is more hesitant to fund something unless it grows as a public good and accumulates more users.\n\nI don’t feel that I have a good grasp on the history of the proposal, so I do not feel confident making a decision. But I will add some point of meta-comment: Individual ideas here are really interesting, such as the Nouns Zine or the Prop House round for funding cover artworks. Splitting these out into their own proposals could be a great way to allow the DAO to pick and choose individual public goods to fund. At the same time, I understand that proposal revisions and the constant “If only there was one more thing…” type of feedback is not particularly helpful, so I know that you may not want to act on it.",

To achieve this, we have made adaptations to Proposal 285 based on two key considerations:\n\n - Addressing community requests: We have carefully taken into account the feedback and incorporated changes accordingly.\n\n - Working within time constraints: We have evaluated what is feasible within the given timeframe and made adjustments.\n\n#### Key Changes and Focus Areas:\n\n - We already sent the sponsors to the first wave of Eletromidia 00H activation. We still have time to phase 2 and 3 of this activation described in [this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JMDP9eevh8a1D7aK3_ZCxQjjTjs2rFufTX09WOiWkt4/edit?usp=sharing).\nThat includes 78 airport screens, 41 commercial buildings spots with 405 screens and more. Over 1 million impressions, we expect great outcomes from this activation)   \n\n - Lower the Metaverse Activation: After considering community feedback, we have decided to lower the Metaverse Activation from the proposal.*\n\n -  Scaling down the lounge to a booth: In response to community feedback on the sponsorship price, we have transformed the lounge into a booth. Additionally, we have adjusted the sponsorship package to align with the revised offering.**\n\n - Collaboration with Aubtoshi for merchandise: Instead of producing our own merchandise, we have decided to collaborate with Aubtoshis and feature their pre-made merchandise.\n\nBy incorporating these changes the proposal addresses community's concerns while still delivering an extraordinary event experience fulfilling the Nouns community expectations. \n\n**OBS***:Nouns building token, Noggles and Some 3D avatars will be airdroped to the community, its done anyways we gotta use it :) \n\n**OBS****: Instead of having 3 people taking care of the Lounge we are going to create booth shifts and also reduce the costs with personal\n\n\n---\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/cNvhtov.png)\n\n## TL:DR \n\nNouns leads the NFT movement in Brazil thanks to its community, but we are just getting started. We are proposing a huge Sao Paulo city takeover starting in NFT.Brasil event.\n\nOur goal is to achieve a massive and innovative onboarding experience for all attendees, and to do so, we will be present in five strategic areas throughout the event journey. These include the NFT Exhibition, Speaker Sessions, Booth, Metaverse, and Street Gallery ([Eletromedia](https://eletromidia.com.br/) OOH advertising). \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3CH4aRq.png)\n\nNFT.Brasil is a pioneering conference celebrating the cutting-edge advancements and possibilities of the NFT world that is set to take place in Sao Paulo city, **Brazil on June 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, 2023.**\n\nNFT.Brasil is performed by the same organizers of [NFT.Rio](https://nftrio.io/), Nouns Community builders (the same people behind Proposals [#142](https://nouns.wtf/vote/142), [#118](https://nouns.wtf/vote/118)   [#98](https://nouns.wtf/vote/98)) in partnership with [MAAC Hub](https://www.instagram.com/maac.hub/). \n\nBuilders: \n\n- [Bob Burnquist ](https://twitter.com/bobburnquist)\n- [Vlad (sktbrd.eth)](https://thatsgnar.ly/thatsgnarly/user/0x41cb654d1f47913acab158a8199191d160dabe4a)\n- [Guiriba](https://twitter.com/guiribabrb) \n- [JP.⌐◨-◨ ](https://twitter.com/eusou_jp)\n- [Ilustradora](https://twitter.com/ilustradoraeth)\n- [Debinvest](https://twitter.com/debinvest) \n- [TheSmith](https://twitter.com/akathesmith) \n- [Fabio Ema](https://twitter.com/FabioEmaArt)  \n- [Lcsant](https://twitter.com/lcsant_eth)\n- [MarcosX.eth](https://www.instagram.com/maac.hub/)\n\n\nWe want to bring Nouns to NFT.Brasil. The event is expected to attract over 30,000 individuals. The venue is the iconic Bienal, which is a true masterpiece of contemporary design, and is a premier cultural destination in Brazil.\n\n## The Brazilian Genesis\n![](https://i.imgur.com/P10GPfy.jpg)\n\n[click here to open](https://i.imgur.com/TfWFIsY.jpeg)\n\n## What is NFT.Brasil?\n\nGet ready to witness an exciting fusion of art, technology, business, networking and innovation at NFT.Brasil, a pioneering conference that is all set to take place at Bienal, an iconic venue in heart of Sao Paulo. The event promises to be a one-of-a-kind experience that brings together digital artists, web3 builders, art enthusiasts, business leaders from outside Web3 to learn and connect new opportunities.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/WS14MiW.gif)\n\nThe mockup video gives you a sneak peek of what's to come: [click here to watch.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCPjVRjLDA)\n\nBienal was designed by the legendary Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer and was first opened in 1951 to host the São Paulo Art Bienal, which is one of the world's most prestigious art exhibitions. \n\nHosting NFT.Brasil conference at the Bienal is a jump from traditional events and a testament to the venue's reputation as a premier cultural destination, and it promises to be an ideal setting for the fusion of art and technology that is at the heart of the NFT movement.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0gS9Ksp.jpg)\n\nThe event is June 2nd, 3rd, and 4th and will be divided into two areas. The NFT exhibition will showcase Brazilian and international artists, collections, projects, and DAOs. The second area will host talks and lectures, bringing the community together to discuss the technology and its impact on our present and future. With a combination of NFT art exhibitions and speaker sessions, the event expects to attract over 30,000 individuals seeking knowledge, connections, and business opportunities in the field. São Paulo is one of the largest and most vibrant cities in the world, making it the perfect backdrop for this exciting event. \n\n## What does Nouns gets by funding this proposal?\n\nBesides being a huge celebration of the Nouns community in Brazil and what we've been building for 9 months after NFT.Rio, and also being a great chance to bring new people on board, Nouns DAO will get:\n\n### Open-air NFT exhibition - [Eletromedia](https://eletromidia.com.br/)\n\nFor 20 days, NFT.Brasil will host the largest open-air NFT exhibition in the world. In partnership with Eletromedia, Brazil's leading Out of Home media company, NFT.Brasil will showcase artists' works  throughout the cities of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, and Fortaleza. \n\nWe want Nouns to be a part of this activation. **Last year at NFT.Rio, the OOH media led the Nouns 367 sale bought by Sanuxo for 113.22 ETH.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HrGlQ5F.jpg)\n\nThe proposed package for this proposal aims 13 days of insertions in strategic points over the city of São Paulo, described as follows:\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/mTmBjNZ/nounify-1.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gtsn3ig.jpg)\n\nSão Paulo is a global city, it's Brazil's highest GDP and the 10th largest in the world with a over 12 million residents. See bellow the distribution of Eletromidia Presence in Sao Paulo\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ydOnnUg.jpg)\n\n\n\n### Nouns Booth\n\n## This would be the new booth position and we are keeping the nounish activations below.\n\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/nR0rS90/nounify.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BlLWPOD.png)\n\n\n### Metaverse (We kept this here cause we are still doing metaverse stuff and what is done will not be undone) \n\nNFT.Brasil is created a metaverse in either Cryptovoxels and Spatial, designed by the talented metarchitect Fabio Ema. During the four-day IRL event, everything will be broadcasted there. After that, the NFT.Brasil team will keep it active for three months with online events, and the community will be able to use it as they see fit, forever. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6cJJdRG.gif)\n\nMake sure to watch the [full video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FfSsVZsFZM)!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LQ8o9JA.jpg)\n\n\nWhen we say take over São Paulo, we mean it. After prop 142 lots of relevant unpredictable things happen. In a meeting with Bob Burnquist the **São Paulo MAYOR** got nounified when checking NFT.Brasil Metaverse for the first time using SkateCuida institute VR headset 👇 (not to mention [random TV exposure](https://skatehive.app/hive-173115/@xvlad/rucfdpzf)) \n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/hZksJkY/ezgif-com-crop.gif)\n\n\n### Main Stage\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dRT2vCC.jpg)\n\n\nAubtoshi is an exciting addition to the lineup of main stage speakers at the upcoming NFT.Brasil event. As a highly influential figure in the Nouns community, Aubtoshi's presentation is sure to be a highlight of the event. Her expertise and experience within the Nouns ecosystem will provide valuable insights for attendees, while her engaging speaking style and natural charisma are sure to captivate the audience. \n\nWe'll also have a builders panel with Nouns BR members such as JP, Guiriba, Debussy, Vlad and others. They will tell  their stories within the ecosystem and invite the audience to join the Nouns community.\n\n### NFT.Brasil Exhibition\n\nNFT.Brasil is excited to announce that the upcoming exhibition will feature an exclusive art display by Nouns, alongside other highly respected collections such as Crypto Punks, Doodles and of course innovative navite brazilian collections. As one of the featured collections, Nouns will have a prominent position in the exhibition, offering visitors a chance to explore the ecosystem and engage with Nouns team. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/uVh9ccj.png)\n\n**Building community, Every Day, Forever**\n\nThis event is not only a celebration of our achievements so far, but also a unique opportunity to showcase Nouns brand to millions of people across Brazil's largest cities for several weeks. As the biggest NFT event in the country, we have the chance to onboard thousands of new community members and take Nouns community in Brazil to the next level.\n\nNFT.Brasil is going to bring more than 5,000 students from public schools with a unique 3-day opportunity to explore the world of digital art. This event not only offers a chance to appreciate the beauty of this art form but also serves as a platform for driving social impact and fostering community development. Alongside Skate Cuida, G10 Favelas, a group of  social impact leaders and entrepreneurs from the Favelas, plays a vital role in this initiative. \n\n## *\"THE REASON IS THE CAUSE AND THE CAUSE IS TO ADVANCE BRASIL IN FUTURE TECHNOLOGY\"*\n> Bob Burnquist\n\n## Budget Breakout in USDC \n\n### - **NFT.Brasil Sponsorship**\n\n- Sponsorship Package - $ 15.000,00 (-5k negotiated discount for ⌐◨-◨ only ) \n    - 13 passports and 40 expo tickets for 3-day event access (raffled off to the Brazilian community)\n    - Main stage speaker (Aubtoshi)\n    - Brand exposure on social media and website\n    - Brand exposure within the event\n    - 5m² booth space\n    ![](https://i.ibb.co/JBsWxYN/image.png)\n\n\n- Street Galery - $ 20.000,00 \n    - Eletromedia (OOH media in São Paulo)\n    - 13 days, NFT.Brasil will host the largest open-air NFT exhibition in the world\n    - [Over 1 Million ⌐◨-◨ impressions](https://eletromidia.com.br/) .\n    - Big Surprise\n\n\n### - **Nouns Activation**\n\n- Booth Construction and Nounification Costs - $ 1.680,00\n    - 3 days rental\n        - 2 TVS + Stands $ 500,00\n        - BackDrop $ 250,00\n        - Booth mobilia (Balcony, chairs, puff)  $ 580,00\n        - Nouns Decoration (Wall Stickers and Fabric) $ 350,00\n\n\n- Booth activation during the 3-day event - During the three-day event, three members of Nouns BR will be shifting in the booth, being entirely dedicated to onboarding new users.

Read the list of builders in the prop. \n\nAfter this first explanation and gathering of nouns community in NFT.Rio many things happened  please check and understand where all this comes from -> https://i.imgur.com/P10GPfy.jpg\n\nPlease read this image and the new disclamer of the proposal changes accordinly with the community feedback. We lowered the sponsorship package, adapted the metaverse action and we are collaborating with aubtoshi for merch, the proposal is 55% cheaper but as Nounish as it can be. We made everything possible to make this happen, would be just SAD to all of us if it didnt.\n\nThis is not just an event. With the event coming, we had the chance to prepare a great OOH media operation, and we created this great package of proliferation, onboarding and celebration. Nouns is already displayed in airports in the moment I am typing this comment.

The core of my reasoning hasn't changed since 285, as I don't think the core of the proposal has changed, either \n> I feel we have funded a lot of things focused on IRL activations recently (262, 257, 251, 218, 206, 197) and I am still sort of waiting for the dust to settle/a clear assessment of our ROI there. In particular, I don't feel a need to fund more NFT event sponsorship/attendance/activation type stuff. \n\nI know there was some pushback on this ROI point: a Noun was sold due to last year's activation! I really like framing returns in terms of bringing in Noun buyers, so I appreciate this. But I am not totally sure how to measure: is the return just the value of that auction? Is it the surplus value vs. the trailing average auction? Or something else? \n\nEven if we say the return should be counted as the total auction value, I feel compelled to stick with my feeling that spending on event sponsorships is not a good use of funds right now. It seems like there is an amazing Nouns community in Brazil and I would love to fund some crazy and fun stuff, perhaps like doubling down on the momentum around the Nounstacle?\n\nThanks again to the proposers!

Comments from the previous prop pasted below. \n\n——\n\nI’m voting against this prop. This conference seems pretty generic as far as NFT/ tech conferences go and I question how much value Nouns will get out of a sponsored presence. That being said, communication from the conference and proposing team has been *inconsistent* at best. \n\nOne of the biggest issues I noticed was 1/3 of the prop money ($30k) would go to a conference “sponsorship” and I still can’t figure out what we would get for that sponsorship. \n\nIn the conference brochure there isn’t a $30k sponsorship package listed, although the team claims they were able to negotiate with “inner web3 circle” for a better deal. \n\nThe sponsorship packages listed in the provided brochure are: $12k, $20k, $40k, $80k, and $200k. So what do we get for our $30k sponsorship exactly? One member of the team mentioned they negotiated the $80k package down to $30k, another member said we are getting the $200k package for $30k. I’m still left trying to figure out what we get for a $30k sponsorship and how can we verify this?  \n\nI requested that the team provide an invoice or some documentation of this $30k sponsorship package and what comes with it, but as of this vote I have not received this. \n\nThere are also inconsistent metrics cited for expected number of attendees. In the prop text, the proposing team claims 30,000 attendees are expected, but then in provided conference graphics the claim is 40,000 attendees are expected. \n\nI think there is enough inconsistency in statements from the team, provided graphics, and plans for spending our investment that we should not grant these funds.",

      "description": "# Nouns Stream Proposal: Payments infrastructure public good by Nouns DAO\n\n# tl;dr\n\n[Nouns Stream](https://www.nouns.stream) is a public good for payments across Noun-ish DAOs and beyond. It is an open-source, free, permission-less protocol that enables **Phased (milestone-based) or Periodic (recurring)** **payments**. This public good can support various payment modes, including peer-to-peer, DAO-to-DAO, community rounds, and grants without complex setup, shadow tokens, or intermediary protocol fees.\n\nNouns Stream does more than further the Nouns’ visual brand/meme; it helps push the ecosystem forward with easy-to-use public goods. This protocol has already been [audited by 0xMacro](https://0xmacro.com/library/audits/nouns-stream-1.html) and deployed across Ethereum ([Mainnet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xB13Afc4f39942b885A00A60A02295016BF82d447#code), [Goerli](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xb6E0407F0094816a67b7d6E2FA27a87be9396f05#code)), Arbitrum ([Mainnet](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xb6E0407F0094816a67b7d6E2FA27a87be9396f05), Goerli), Optimism ([Mainnet](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xb6E0407F0094816a67b7d6E2FA27a87be9396f05), Goerli), Polygon ([Mainnet](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xb6E0407F0094816a67b7d6E2FA27a87be9396f05), [Mumbai](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0xb6E0407F0094816a67b7d6E2FA27a87be9396f05)) and Base ([Goerli](https://goerli.basescan.org/address/0xb6E0407F0094816a67b7d6E2FA27a87be9396f05)).\n\nThe protocol developers, who are also Nouns’ holders, are asking for a retroactive grant of **16 eth** to cover the cost of the audit (US$25,000 ie ~14 eth) and deployment (US$5,000 ie ~2 eth).\n\n![Untitled](https://i.imgur.com/9g5l0ZE.png)\n\n# Problem\n\nNouns and Noun-ish DAOs have no recourse or control over outgoing funds due to a successful proposal. If a team fails to deliver or meet certain milestones, the community cannot vote to recall the remaining funds.\n\nMoreover, contributors to longer-running, phased projects need more certainty. Today they are forced to make a single, big ask for funding or create multiple proposals over the life of their project to secure continued funding. Unfortunately, such uncertainty doesn’t help set up ambitious developers, artists, and creators for success.\n\nLastly, as the community evolves, it may pay specific contributors— e.g., IRL Events Coordinator — a fixed amount per quarter, paid bi-weekly.\n\nWithin the community, we have seen a healthy debate between funding experiments to further the meme while keeping treasury spending in check. Tooling like Nouns Stream helps balance where milestone-based payments can commit to experiments and revert (via Proposal) if a project is not delivering the promised objectives.\n\n# Proposal\n\nThe Nouns Stream protocol is open-source, free, and permissionless. It allows anyone to set up an escrow account that is funded with funds later disbursed via one of two modes:\n\n1. Phased (i.e., milestone-based)\n2. Periodic (i.e., regular intervals)\n\nTo further clarify and formally define:\n\n1. **Phased:** these are milestone-based payments where the funds are set up to be disbursed in predefined amounts on fixed dates. The dates and amounts for each milestone are set up during contract deployment. Configuring payment amounts on a milestone basis allows for unique cases requiring larger upfront payments to bootstrap projects. For example, a proposal for 75 eth might be broken into four parts over some fixed dates like:\n    1. 04-10-2023: 35 eth\n    2. 04-20-2023: 5 eth\n    3. 04-30-2023: 15 eth\n    4. 05-15-2023: 20 eth\n2. **Periodic:** these are recurring payouts at fixed intervals defined in days or weeks. For example, a proposal could be set up to pay a community contributor 24 eth for the next three months (12 weeks) at two-week intervals, i.e., they will get paid 4 eth every two weeks from the escrow.\n\nThe Controller/Sender (e.g. Nouns Governor’s Contract in the case of Nouns DAO) is the only party that can cancel the escrow and recalls funds. The Receiver can’t withdraw funds before said strike dates. Such controls allow the community to create follow-up proposals and recall funds if a project is not believed to deliver on its promise long-term.\n\nThe protocol has a tipping mechanism where payments will be pushed to the receiving address if the payout is set up with a tip incentive. This avoids the need for Receiver to claim/withdraw funds. If no tip percentage is defined during contract deployment, the Receiver has to withdraw funds as they become available manually. Today, the tips are hard-coded to go to a fixed address. The developers will release an update within a few weeks where anyone who helps run these transactions can trigger transactions and earn tips.\n\nWith predictable payout timelines, Nouns Square can hold regular Demo Day sessions for projects to share progress against milestones 👀\n\nSome previous proposals that could’ve directly benefited from the proposed payment infrastructure include:\n\n- [Fund design, engineering, and community contributors](https://nouns.wtf/vote/17)\n- [Prop House Protocol: Public Infrastructure by Nouns DAO](https://nouns.wtf/vote/105)\n- [Nounish Dataverse, open source data](https://nouns.wtf/vote/240)\n- [Nouns Deli Melbourne: Piloting a Nounish Franchise Model](https://nouns.wtf/vote/254)\n\nNouns Stream distinguishes from existing protocols such as Juicebox and Sablier through focused features, better user experience and Nounish visual branding:\n\n1. It is visually propagating the Nouns meme\n2. Providing a point-and-click user experience that any proposer can use to set up an escrow\n3. Leverages CREATE2 opcode to provide future contract address, thus eliminating the need to pre-emptively deploy contracts or setup streams before Proposal has passed\n4. Phased payment unlocks on pre-determined milestone dates\n5. Capability to setup different payment amount for each phase within project\n6. Zero fees, forever, and low gas\n7. No secondary token to swap and manage\n8. Sender/Controller fully controls the funds, i.e., DAO or multi-sig, who adds funds to the deployed contract\n\n# Deliverables & Ask\n\nEverything has been built as open source and under the GPL license. The deliverables include a developer (React) SDK, allowing other developers to under this infrastructure within their applications. In addition, 0xMacro has [audited](https://0xmacro.com/library/audits/nouns-stream-1.html) the project.\n\n**The total ask for this project is 16 eth.**\n\nThis funding will help the developers (retroactively) cover:\n\n- cost of the audit completed by 0xMacro (US$25,000 ie ~14 eth)\n- cost of contract deployment across all networks (US$5,000 ie ~2 eth)\n\nIn the future, the developers want to extend Nouns Build and add these payout options natively (via pull request) to the project. However, this Proposal doesn’t ask for funding for any such future development:\n\n![Untitled](https://i.imgur.com/3OVz9Ll.png)\n\n# Contributors\n\nMatthew (evav.eth, Noun#604, LilNoun#5834+5, Builder#67, Gnar#3750): 5+ years as blockchain engineer who has worked on various protocols including [Burrata.xyz](http://Burrata.xyz).\n\nOsama (osama.eth, osamakhan.eth, Noun#463, LilNoun#5703, Builder#54, Gnar#553): 2+ years blockchain product/engineering and has helped build [OlympusDAO.finance](http://OlympusDAO.finance) and [Burrata.xyz](http://Burrata.xyz). \n\nOsama and Matthew have also been involved in the founding of Purple DAO — flagship Nouns Build DAO based around the Farcaster network.",

In the event that we do need to halt funding to a project, milestone dates provide specific moments where the DAO can focus attention on evaluating proposal outcomes. This also adds incentive for proposers to create reasonable timelines and goals that they need to hit. I am supportive of development in this area.\n\nThis proposal is to retrofund an audit by 0xMacro and cover deployment costs. In general I think this is reasonable ask, however in proposal discussions further serious issues were found with the code. The audit clearly states \"this audit should not solely be relied upon for security\". Suddenly covering the audit costs becomes less compelling.\n\nSo what are we supposed to do? What should we rely on for security? Multiple audits? Code4rena? Is there a way to formalize and decentralize how we approach both DAO upgrades and contract interactions? \n\nI am abstaining on this one.",

My only main concerns here are (1) what the competitive set of tools offer (like 0xSplits) and if they/others have similar solutions on roadmap, and (2) if there are better ways for this to be affiliated by Nouns (the website is cool, having Nouns graffiti in the contract code would be cooler).

      "description": "# Clothing, Every Day, Forever\n\n## **TL;DR** \n- Allocate **75,800 USDC** for the development of **wears.wtf⌐◨-◨**, a  clothing brand that transforms Nouns' incredible CC0 assets into distinctive, ready-to-wear clothing.\n- By **collaborating with [LEBLANCSTUDIOS](https://www.instagram.com/leblancstudios/?hl=en), a fashion brand with 10+ years in experience**, we seek to bring wears.wtf⌐◨-◨ to market very smoothly. \n    - Initial collection marketing will be directed towards the Nounish Ecosystem, Twitter, and LEBLANCSTUDIOS' customer base (3500+ customers). \n- This process will be divided in 2 phases: [PROOF-OF-DEMAND] and [PRODUCTION EXPANSION].\n    - **[PROOF-OF-DEMAND]** is this **current** proposal.\n        - Includes a 100-200 piece test limited-edition drop to measure demand and other metrics. \n        - After the test drop, we'll be launching a 400 piece drop focused on the nounssentials line (explained later on the prop). \n    - **[PRODUCTION EXPANSION]** would be a **future** proposal. \n    - After both phases are done, wears.wtf⌐◨-◨ will effectively become completely self-sustainable,and will keep iterating, experimenting, and ultimately growing as a business & platform. \n- wears.wtf⌐◨-◨ opens up endless possibilities, such as creating limited edition clothing for an specific cause, designing apparel inspired by Nouns community events, and incorporating fashion into proposals across various domains.\n\n## **THE WEARS.WTF TEAM** \n\n[LEBLANCSTUDIOS](https://www.instagram.com/leblancstudios/?hl=en). A Dominican clothing brand founded in 2014. With an awareness of globalization, highlighting personal identity, LEBLANCSTUDIOS strives to become a social and cultural  movement that empowers an emerging generation of people across all continents to express themselves.  **LEBLANCSTUDIOS is available among retailers like [ODIN NYC](https://odinnewyork.com/) (USA) and [THE FORUMIST](https://store.theforumist.com/) (EUROPE)**.\n- **LEBLANCSTUDIOS will provide the following talent to the wears.wtf team**: \n    - 2 Senior Creative Directors & Co-Founders of LEBLANCSTUDIOS:\n        -  Angelo Beato & Yamil Arbaje\n    - Fashion Marketer, Pattern Maker, Material Sourcing Specialist, Production Manager, Sales/E-COMM Manager, Graphic Designer, Copywriter, Editor\n\n- **LEBLANCSTUDIOS is also providing already established partnerships with manufacturers in the following countries**: Turkey, Peru, India, Italy, Portugal, China, USA\n\n\n[necfas](https://twitter.com/necfas). I (necfas) have always desired to wear clothing that embodies the essence of Nouns in one way or another. Rather than purchasing generic t-shirts and having them embroidered or printed myself, I wanted apparel that genuinely reflects the unique significance that Nouns hold for me. As the nounish creative lead, my role is to ensure that the designs we create are in sync with the Nouns culture. I will be responsible for providing creative suggestions and guidance, aiming to produce intriguing and exceptional designs that best represent the essence of Nouns. This is a genuine, wholehearted attempt to offer something that could potentially bring significant value to the DAO. \n\n\n\n## **2 PHASES**\n### [PROOF-OF-DEMAND] & [PRODUCTION EXPANSION]\n\n- This phase aims to gauge the community's interest in the clothing line by producing a limited-edition, low-supply (100-200) collection. After the test drop, we'll be launching a 400 piece drop focused on the nounssentials line. Phase 1's marketing will be focused towards the Nouns community, twitter, and LEBLANCSTUDIOS' customer base. We will use promotional videos and clothing shoots to gather attention for the launch. \n\n    -  **Phase 1 will clearly define the following metrics**:\n        - Cost of Goods Sold \n        - Gross Margin\n        - Operating Expenses\n        - Net Profit Margin\n        - Sell-through Rate\n        - Conversion Rate\n        - Average Order Value (AOV)\n        - Return on Investment (ROI) - limited to the scale of the first collection\n    \n*The wears.wtf team will produce reports of these metrics on a regular basis in order to be as transparent as possible.* \n\n- Once PROOF-OF-DEMAND is completed, we'll move on to the next phase PRODUCTION EXPANSION, a future proposal. We'll start producing the other clothing lines, like NOUNSWEAR and NOUNSJACKETS (explained later in the prop). \n    - After the Production Expansion phase, the project will be able to support itself, and we'll always include special Nounish details in our branding to maintain the origin. We'll also make sure nounssentials are available to purchase online everyday, forever. Phase 2 will include a thourough marketing campaign that will focus on expanding to a broader audience, including non-crypto-natives by leveraging all of the metrics acquired during phase 1. \n\n    -  **Phase 2 will clearly define the following metrics**:\n        - Inventory Turnover\n        - Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) \n        - Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)\n        - Conversion Rate\n        - Customer Retention Rate\n        - Return on Investment (ROI) - overall various collections\n\n\n\n## **HOW**\n\n **Collaboration and Design Process**: \n- The LEBLANCSTUDIOS' team and I (necfas) have worked to create unique designs that resonate with the Nouns community. The design process will involve brainstorming, sketching, and refining concepts that embody the essence of the community and its values.\n-  This collaboration ensures that the final designs are a perfect blend of art, fashion, and what's considered nounish.\n\n**Design Selection and Production**: \n- After gathering feedback and iterating on the designs, the team will finalize 8 different designs for the nounssentials drop, once the [PROOF-OF-DEMAND] limited edition TEST drop is complete.\n- the [PROOF-OF-DEMAND] limited edition TEST drop will consist of 100-200 limited edition pieces.\n- The nounssentials 8 final designs, 400 piece drop will be done afterwards. \n\n*note: Scaling down production was considered, but even if the Nouns ecosystem doesn’t purchase the proposed amounts, LEBLANCSTUDIOS’ customer base will. They’ve shown excitement for the unique designs they’ve never seen before. It’s crucial for us to begin working on the next collection batch right after the test drop. Going through another proposal process, which would cause weeks of funding delay, wouldn’t be optimal for securing production spots and establishing dates with the manufacturers by paying upfront.*\n\n**Quality and Sustainability**: \n- The wears.wtf team has prioritized finding the best sustainable quality/price ratio for the garments. \n- We are in contact with reputable manufacturers to ensure ethically made clothing, and that the final products are not only stylish and comfortable but also durable. \n\n**Community Feedback and Iteration**: \n- Throughout the design process, the team will engage with the community through twitter & discord (JUNGLE, NOUNISH, NOUNCIL) to gather feedback on the proposed designs.\n-  By conducting polls, discussions, and sharing design mockups, the team will ensure that the community's preferences and ideas are taken into account. This iterative approach will help refine the designs, making them more appealing to the community members.\n\n**Launching the First Collection**: \n- Once the designs are finalized and produced, the first drop of the wears.wtf collection will be launched. This collection will focus on creating clothing that embodies the \"Clothing, Every Day, Forever\" concept, making it an essential piece for every Nouns community member's wardrobe. \n- By offering versatile and stylish garments, the collection aims to become an integral part of the community members' daily lives, allowing them to express their Nounishness.\n\n\n## **CLOTHING, EVERYDAY, FOREVER** \n\n### **NOUNSSENTIALS: Made for everyone. For Everyday, Forever.**\n- **Essential clothes** **made** **from sustainable materials** include items like organic cotton t-shirts, hemp or linen pants, and bamboo socks. By choosing sustainable materials for our everyday clothing, we can make a positive impact on the environment while also staying comfortable and stylish.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BYTzO1m.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CkvjwWq.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YTMLZ8S.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qKRb4am.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GJUnNn6.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5FphJbM.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AQcSXGn.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tJYYR8Q.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DU75H6a.png)\n*THESE ARE NOT FINAL DESIGNS*\n\n\n### **NOUNSWEAR: Creative Expression**\n- NOUNSWEAR **aims to explore the streetwear and artistic aspects of clothing**, emphasizing creativity, unique designs, and personal expression, which caters to those looking to make a bold fashion statement. It will follow a drop-by-drop format with limited edition pieces, taking into account essential Nounish activities and accomplishments. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/L4okh4b.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ufqJU9Z.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5UUylyH.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PjQzU3b.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Vhzfy8j.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HGnwvMa.png)\n*THESE ARE NOT FINAL DESIGNS*\n\n\n### **NOUNSJACKET: Nounish Representation**\n\n- The NOUNSJACKET **aims to be a set of tailor made jacket for different NOUNISH BUILDERS that have constant exposure to a wide audience** (Nouns Fair, Aubtoshi, Becco, Nounsesports, etc).\n- The jackets will be designed through back and forth conversations with differet builders about their preferences and the representative elements they would like in their jackets. Builders will be able to contact the team in order to tailor-make their jacket with the specific requirements they would want. \n![](https://i.imgur.com/u8vI8Fs.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Wg7vavU.png)\n*THESE ARE NOT FINAL DESIGNS*\n\n\n## **THIS ISN'T MERCH, THIS IS READY-TO-WEAR**\n- **Ready-to-wear clothing offers a superior level of comfort and everyday wearability compared to merch, thanks to its focus on quality materials, design, fit, and attention to detail**. These collections will be crafted by experienced designers who prioritize the use of high-quality fabrics and materials, ensuring a more comfortable and durable experience. \n- Moreover, ready-to-wear pieces will be meticulously designed with silhouette, fit, and proportion in mind, providing a better overall fit and feel. **The versatility of ready-to-wear clothing makes it easy for consumers to incorporate these pieces into their daily wardrobe**, as they offer a range of styles that can be easily mixed and matched.\n\n\n## **WHAT DOES A CC0 CLOTHING BRAND LOOK LIKE?**\n- We believe that wears⌐◨-◨.wtf has the potential to innovate in fashion by leveraging CC0 assets to create unique and innovative clothing designs. \n- By incorporating elements from various web3 projects and the broader public domain, wears.wtf can develop a diverse range of apparel that reflects the creative spirit of the internet and empowers individuals to express their unique identities.\n- As Nouns allows for this CC0-POWERED clothing brand, integration and collaboration with other artists, brands, and CC0 projects can lead to outstanding success by exploring a niche with a format that no one is currently exploring. \n\n\n## **TIMELINE [PROOF-OF-DEMAND]**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CqaF99V.png)\n*TOTAL 26 WEEKS*\n*AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE: EARLY NOVEMBER*\n\n\n## **PHASE 2: [PRODUCTION EXPANSION]** \n- The subsequent proposal will focus on funding a larger production and adopting a more targeted approach, informed by the metrics gathered during this initial phase. All profits generated in this first phase will be reinvested by wears.wtf to minimize expenses required for execution.\n    - In this phase, we'll develop NOUNSSENTIALS, NOUNSWEAR, and NOUNSJACKETS in collection sizes that meet the growing demand. \n    - After Phase 2, wears.wtf will be a self-sustainable project that proudly represents its origins in Nouns. \n        - After developing all Nounish lines, we'll then be open to explore collaborations with other communities like Cryptoadz, Checks, Opepen, CryptoDickButts, Mfers, Rektguy, etc. \n\n- As crypto, NFTs, and Web3 continue to grow, so will our consumer base. Together with LEBLANCSTUDIOS, we're dedicated to creating high-quality products that people will love not just for the designs, but for the quality as well.\n\n***Wears.wtf aims to establish itself as a valuable platform powered by Nouns, with the goal of creating a long-term project that benefits not only the Nouns ecosystem but also the broader web3 community.***\n\n## **BUDGET** \n![](https://i.imgur.com/UMjOx50.png)\n\n*Budget for phase 2 will be measurable once we have all of the metrics that will be provided by this first proposal.*",

Is this public good something that other organizations won’t fund, or that Nouns is uniquely best to fund?\n\nWhile the idea is fun and interesting, I don’t see a situation where it needs upfront funding from the DAO. Selling NFTs for pre-orders or pursuing other funding models and letting demand come bottom-up seems ideal. This has an excellent established path to funding that doesn’t require upfront payments from the DAO. I like the idea, but I don’t think that Nouns is uniquely best positioned to fund it.\n\nIt would be helpful to have more examples of which components are CC0. The proposal refers to it as a CC0 clothing brand, but it mentions using CC0 assets rather than making new CC0 assets. If the brand itself created CC0 elements in addition to leveraging CC0 elements, that would be very intriguing.",

      "description": "# Nounish Playground - The Game\n\n# Nounish Playground - The Game\n\n## TL;DR:\nWe're proposing to build a mobile platformer game with 700 levels in which we introduce players to nounish concepts and educate them on Nouns DAO and adjacent extensions while playing through fun and engaging maps. While the total budget required to complete the game development is $200,000, we are seeking funding of **$90,000** for the alpha version, which will include an **early access** release. The alpha version is expected to take 6 months to complete, followed by an additional 6 months until the final release. Once the alpha version is released, we will require the remaining budget to complete the development of the game.\n\n---\n\n## Description\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/egqCNYh.jpg)\n\n**Click on the image to view the proposed game design.**\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/j38RqEz.jpg)\n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toY9TC21gyQ)\n\n\n---\n### The game is divided into two parts:\n- Single Player\n- Multiplayer\n\n### Single Player\nThe single-player mode is a platformer game.\n\nIn this mode the player controls their noun to reach its destination - to be minted and sent to auction at **Nouns DAO**.\n\nThere is a unique level for each noun minted, designed with various obstacles and challenges.\n\nWe as a nounish family are waiting every day to see what the next noun will look like and how much the winning bid is at the auction for the previous noun, but we don't know anything about each noun’s background story. We don't know what a noun has been through before it gets minted! This concept was the inspiration for this game.\n\n### Getting to know **Nounish culture**\n\nSome stages of the game are designed to indirectly teach players about the Nounish culture and the **NounsDAO** mechanism. Players will be enticed to go through these stages in order to obtain valuable rewards, and in the process, they will come across learning opportunities to grasp these concepts. We believe that direct teaching of these concepts might not be engaging for players, so we aim to make the learning experience more fun and interactive through gameplay.\n\n**Click on the picture below to see the video**👇\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/GjT0Tiw.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lclo8l3t_g)\n\n#### Gameplay\nThe player controls their noun throughout each level in a 3D playground. Nouns can run, jump, grab, climb, dive + more to overcome the obstacles until the final point is reached and the noun goes through the gate to get minted.\n\nThere is ether on the path that the player must collect to meet the goal. The goal amount of ether is set based on how much that noun sold for at auction.\n\nAfter completing each level, the player is awarded three stars. The first star is just for completing the level and the second one is awarded if the count of collected ether has reached the winning bid amount and the last star is awarded based on the time spent completing the level.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wgcyHFh.gif)\n\n\nFor example: The first level is about Noun 1 being minted and the player will have to guide the noun through the course while collecting enough ether to meet the winning bid on that noun, while trying to do it in the fastest time possible.\n\n**Click on the pictures below to watch an example of the Noun 1 & 2 levels of the game 👇**\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/b8ymd4i.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz-ouU8xErE)\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/06KwPXg.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YxpdSb2iYo)\n\n### Multiplayer\nIn this mode of the game, players enter a battle royal like Fall Guys and compete with one another.\n\nEach session starts with 40 players and three matches are held in each session. At the end of each match, only half of the players walk it through, then at the end of the third match, the final player wins the match.\n\nThe game and environment design is nounish and each level/match has its own unique theme based on nounish extensions such as lil nouns, Gnars DAO, Alps DAO, and many others where spectators are members of these communities.\n\nIn multiplayer mode, we’ll hold monthly in-game events relevant to DAO news, events, and popular holidays.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/h41ZJ6O.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UkWHRQ5.png)\nWe aim to differentiate our game from competitors by improving the user experience and providing creative ideas, attractive maps, and Nouns that engage players in exciting challenges. Ultimately, our focus is on delivering a flawless and engaging game experience, and continuously improving it to create a supportive and enjoyable experience for players.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/aaNzoDt.png)\nAfter the full release of the game, we plan to hold various competitions, ranging from seasonal events to in-game events and those related to important events in the NounsDAO community. By offering special Nouns-related prizes, our goal is to create more challenges for players and familiarize them with DAOs and NFTs. Additionally, we can hold custom events upon the request of NounsDAO.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/r4In8Ph.png)\nWe aim to reach **25,000** downloads in the first month after the game's release, and strive to achieve a steady growth rate of **5%** in monthly downloads. We intend to encourage players to engage in the single-player mode and invite their friends to play the multiplayer mode.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JV5rG3L.png)\nWe incentivize players to invite their friends to play the game by offering rewards. Additionally, we create private clones for players to have a space to discuss the game.\n\n---\n\n## Why a Mobile Game?\nMobile games are easily available to everyone with a smartphone these days and have a wide audience range.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5n5Er5H.jpg)\n\n---\n\n## Nouns DAO community?\n\nGiven the importance of the Nouns DAO community to our game, we have decided to leverage the collaboration with its members by inviting them to contribute ideas, feedback, and even resources to the game. This action will help foster a sense of ownership and strengthen the connection between our game and the community, ultimately ensuring its success.\nIn addition to inviting Nouns DAO members to collaborate on the game, we have decided to launch a Discord channel to share the game's production stages with the Nouns community. This channel will serve as a communication space for receiving ideas, feedback, and criticism from Nouns community members, as well as a place to showcase the game's development stages and updates to them. By doing so, we can listen to user feedback more effectively and make the best decisions for the game in sync with the community.\n\n---\n\n## How Long Will It Take To Produce?\n\nThe early access version will be released after 6 months and then it will take 6 months more until the final release.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vV3NDUV.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6vUzwGF.png)\n\n---\n\nYou've seen and love our work with the nounish music videos we've created, let's make a game with even more impact!\n\n---\n\n## Marketing\n- App Store Optimization (ASO): This gives maximum exposure to our game in the store by lowering our cost per install (CPI) and filtering high-value users. It all needs to have localized content (Keywords, Categories, Screenshots, and Video Trailers) per region and culture. This is a full-time job of a user acquisition manager excluding producing visual content.\n- Landing page: This is a one-page website where customers can learn more about our game. The landing page includes links to the App Store and Google Play Store, promo videos, a call-to-action, screenshots, gameplay trailers and reviews.\n- Running paid Youtube and social media ads: Targeted ads on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter. These platforms allow us to reach specific audiences based on factors such as demographics, interests, and behaviors.(The cost will be optimized by ASO)\n- Offering incentives for referrals: Encourage existing players to share the game with their friends by offering rewards or incentives for referrals.\n- Influencer marketing: Partnering with social media influencers or YouTubers who have a relevant audience can be an effective way to generate buzz and interest in the game. The budget could be used to compensate these influencers for promoting the game on their channels.\n----\n\n## Monetization\n- In-app purchases: Our game will offer a variety of ways for players to make in-app purchases to enhance their gaming experience and generate revenue for the game.\n  - In-Game Items: Players can purchase in-game items such as currency, power-ups, and other bonuses to improve their gameplay.\n  - Battle Passes: Players can purchase a Battle Pass to unlock new game modes, competitions, and exclusive rewards for a limited time. This popular monetization strategy creates a sense of urgency and excitement for players, increasing engagement and revenue for the game.\n  - (By offering these in-app purchases, we can provide players with new and exciting ways to engage with the game while generating revenue for the project.)\n- Sponsorship or Brand Partnerships: Collaborating with a brand to promote their product or service within the game. This can generate revenue without relying solely on in-app purchases.\n- Crowdfunding: As part of our monetization plan, we will be leveraging the power of NFTs to offer a unique crowdfunding option for our game. By purchasing an NFT from us, supporters will not only be helping to fund the development of our game, but they will also receive exclusive in-game items and benefits.\n\nThe NFTs purchased through our crowdfunding campaign will be useable within the game as character skins, attachments, and other in-game items. This provides a unique and exciting opportunity for our supporters to be part of the game's development and to have a tangible stake in its success.\n\nAdditionally, these NFTs can be traded on secondary markets, creating a potential revenue stream for our supporters and adding to the game's overall ecosystem. We believe that this innovative use of NFTs in crowdfunding will not only benefit our game's development, but also provide a new way for people to support and engage with the project.\n\n\n----\n\n\n## Who Are We?\nThe **[Genius Slackers](https://geniusslackers.com/)** team is an independent producer of video games. The company was founded in 2016 by [Arash Negahban](https://twitter.com/ArashSlacker) and Saeed Abbasi.\n\nWe're an experienced video game development team that created the psychological horror game \"**[What Happened](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1296290/What_Happened/)**,\" which won the Chainsaw Award for its fantastic story. Following that success, we worked on various outsource projects.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/lXo2DNn.png)\n\nNow, we are proud to announce our second in-house game project, **Nounish Playground**.\nThis project is a testament to our determination and our commitment to creating exceptional games.

By leveraging these strategies, our game will not only provide players with a fun and engaging experience, but it will also introduce them to the exciting world of Nouns DAO and cryptocurrency.\n\nThrough our ASO, paid ads, and referral incentives, we aim to reach a wide audience and drive downloads. Our monetization plan includes in-app purchases, battle passes, brand partnerships, and innovative NFT-based crowdfunding that will allow supporters to contribute to the game's development while receiving exclusive in-game items and benefits.\n\nWith all of the game's content being open-source and available to the public, we are committed to continually updating and expanding the game over time. By voting for our proposal, you are supporting a game that is not only entertaining and engaging but also pushing the boundaries of gaming and crypto.\n\n---\n\n## Game Engine\nWith **Unreal Engine 5**, we have access to a variety of powerful web3 plugins that enable us to seamlessly integrate blockchain and NFT features into our upcoming mobile platformer game. We're excited to leverage the engine's capabilities to create an immersive and innovative gaming experience for our players.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mub7e3k.png)\n\n---\n\n## Measuring Success\nWe will be able to measure success in a number of ways including, but not limited to:\n- analytics on game installs/downloads\n- daily active users\n- call to action clicks\n- landing page metrics\n- social media engagement and analytics\n\n---\n\n### Thank you for your consideration! We hope to get the chance to build the best and most nounish game to exist",

Is this public good something that other organizations won’t fund, or that Nouns is uniquely best to fund?\n\nThis game, while potentially enjoyable art, is not a public good. It is not CC0 or freely licensed, and it can't be easily remixed by other Nouns supporters.\n\nIt is a business that may be successful and sustainable in its own right. That is excellent! There are many great venues for funding this, from venture capital to grants programs within the games industry to crowdfunding. The authors themselves point to crowdfunding as a potential option for fundraising for this game. But since there are many potential funding sources outside of Nouns, I don't believe that Nouns should find this.\n\nAs a result, I don't believe that this proposal is something that Nouns is uniquely suited to fund. I agree with Jihad that retroactive funding could be appropriate if this benefits Nouns, but I don't believe that Nouns should kickstart this. I would also reconsider this if the game were freely licensed and provided a building block for others to make Nounish games too. As it stands, other funding venues are likely more appropriate.",

          "reason": "One of the biggest lessons that the web3 community should have learned after the hype of 2021/2022 is that developing video games is a challenging task — and beyond the challenges of development, marketing them to stand out in the crowded field of mobile games is yet another challenge. While I appreciate the effort and initiative behind this proposal, I'm skeptical about its ability to make a significant impact.\n\nHowever, beyond all of that the REAL deal-breaker for me is the proposed monetization strategies. In-app purchases and crowdfunding mechanics may work for some games, but I believe they miss the mark for the Nouns community. If the goal is to proliferate the Nouns meme, a DAO-funded game should be free to play, and the focus should be on creating an engaging, memorable experience that leaves players wanting to learn more about Nouns, not spending a few dollars on micro-transactions.\n\nIt's important to remember that successful games with an emphasis on multiplayer are built on communities and sustained by passionate players. If the proposed game fails to create an experience that resonates with the a wider audience, it has no real purpose. Ultimately, I think it's important for the Nouns community to continue experimenting and exploring with projects of this nature, but we need to ensure that they align with the DAO's goals before gaining funding.",

      "description": "# Archives.wtf - Extension\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HRZT5II.jpg)\n\n## **1. TL;DR**\n\nWe would like to seek funding of 192.4K USDC *(~99 ETH)* to keep maintaining & developing [archives.wtf](https://archives.wtf/) as the main archive center of Nouns DAO over the next 6 months (May '23-Oct '23). Our focus is to increase the current media contents of Nouns ecosystem with the support of software improvements & public goods tools together enhancing user experiences.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Proposal Summary**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FKYUjfp.jpg)\n\n### **Prop 176 Recap**\n\nOn December 3rd, we were [funded](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdd7e4d8a5fef6702f7e9c5b45db440ba7a6e00c0#internaltx) of 32.28 ETH ($42K) to build an archive center which stores & display all media contents of Nouns DAO's projects & artworks and all the memes proliferations.\n\n**In the past 4 months we have ;**\n\n1. [Archives.wtf](https://archives.wtf/) - built a reliable archive website from the ground up\n2. Built features ; [link to thread](https://twitter.com/thevoadz/status/1641034993798467593?s=20)\n* under any categories, you can search any related data within the page, eg ; **Nouns On-chain Proposal**\n    * prop number\n    * project title\n    * description\n    * builders/artists\n    * category\n* we enable **scroll, filter & search persistence** for better user navigation ( which stored on your device )\n* you can use **cmd+k / ctrl+k** for quick access to search in page\n* cc0 icon & download button\n3. As per 4/11/2023, we have gathered and archived ;\n* [Proposals](https://archives.wtf/props) ([On-chain](https://archives.wtf/props/onchain), [Prop House](https://archives.wtf/props/prop-house) & [NSFW](https://archives.wtf/props/nsfw-small-grants)) ; **611 proposals, 410 builders**\n* Contests by [Noun Square](https://archives.wtf/special), [4156](https://archives.wtf/nouns), [Gnars DAO](https://archives.wtf/subdao/gnars-dao), [Noadz](https://archives.wtf/noggles/noggles-art-contest) ; **606 artworks & entries, 326 artists**\n    * Nouniversary\n    * Nouns Holiday\n    * Nouns Mash-up\n    * Nouns Movies\n    * Nouns Sneakers\n    * Nouns Esports\n    * Nouns Space\n    * 100 Days of Nouns\n\n4. Total No of Builders - [Link](https://voadz.notion.site/ca874dfc6bff42eb9ae48e1af51d9258?v=3ef4593de67d487b9f50c625c7e46de2)\n5. Built a tool named [Uploadr](https://uploadr.app/) for quick data upload & storage to the Arweave network\n6. Organized & compiled full database in [Nouns Archive's Notion](https://voadz.notion.site/Nouns-Archive-da52f93301dd4ed59e5b876bd5151d93)\n\n**Feedbacks from the communities**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Rzlefqe.png)\n**Past reference**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7JC7JYU.png)\n\n---\n\n## **3. Project Goals For Upcoming 6 Months**\n\n### **The Key Challenges**\nFrom [Prop 176](https://nouns.wtf/vote/176) :\n\n* There isn't currently a main archive center that stores and display all datas like \n    * proposal progress images/videos\n    * end product images/videos/links/repo\n    * nounish artworks from contests, events\n    * cc0 contents & working files\n* It is difficult for new people to discover any nounish contents because it is dispersed everywhere, throughout Twitter, Instagram & other platforms unless they have their own website or media-oriented approach which uses apps like Youtube. Particularly from the perspective of those who do not fully comprehend the Nouns ecosystem and where they might find it.\n* There is no specific rule for proposers to update their project progress everyday, fortnightly, or once a month but we could encourage people to do that more often if we help to provide the right tools.\n* Some builders with huge outcomes but stucked with time constraint need an additional support to archive their outputs.\n\nAs a central resource platform, cross pollination is one of things needed. Some of the early builders require assistance with visibility. With the connected links that point people to each nounish projects and builders, we assist the public in finding them.\n\n### **The Strategies**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EKvVcFO.png)\n\n**Strategy 1 ; Curated submission form**\n\n* We want to build **a curated submission form** attached to the website which benefits from multiple touchpoints.\n* Users are required for wallet connect (NNS supported) and could request to submit a new sub-category and additional contents to their existing proposals/details.\n* The forms will allow users to select their preferred category, status, type of house, round, etc. *(based on specific usage)*\n* User can check their submission history together with submission details *(eg; date, title & status)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zRGCmYR.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kYzeI8v.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AUrMjNR.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1rQXaEQ.png)\n\n---\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gVzs6Ih.png)\n\n**Strategy 2 ; Uploader**\n\n* We want to improvise an [uploader](https://uploadr.app/) with some new features which we have built for the past few months.\n* Users are required for wallet connect (NNS supported) & it will be token gated focusing on Nouns ecosystem to use it for free ;\n    * Nounders\n    * Nouners\n    * Nounish Builders\n    * Sub DAOs\n    * Nouns' NFT Open Edition Holders / Droposals *(This Is Nouns, The Wizard's Hat etc)*\n* Anyone who has just got noun-pilled into the ecosystem and want to use it, they may choose from any of the available criteria above. This will gradually benefit the Nouns DAO ecosystem over time.\n* User can check their upload history together with the details *(eg; date, title & arweave link)*\n* The fee of the uploaded permanent data is included under **OpEx** in ***Budget***.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IoUQQkb.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KFIzROZ.png)\n\n---\n\n**Strategy 3 ; Tooling R&D**\n\n* We want to create and launch tooling research and development that will bring significant effect on the process and project's efficiency and for the DAO where everyone could benefit from it.\n* We will use the fund under **OpEx** in ***Budget***.\n\n**The strategies mentioned are what we are focused on so far, but they are subject to change along the way or the best recommendations from the community. There will be more along the journey.*\n\n### **Data Permanence**\n\n* We are using **Arweave** network to store all the datas due to its one time fee permanent storage and we want to use it exclusively for all storage going forward.\n* Currently, around **40%** of the datas are now saved on Arweave, with the remaining **60%** being processed. *(Currently on Notion)*\n* There have been a few instances where artists or builders have discontinued their hosting and lost their tracks; this is something we do not want to happen again.\n* We want to make sure all datas of Nouns ecosystem are permanently stored in a decentralised manner and is always accessible.\n* We are able to boost the website's performance with the help of **Vercel Edge Network** which offers image optimization, page load speed & automatically data cached on the network.\n* The cost of uploading will be factor in under **OpEx** as per attached in ***Budget***.\n* Publish monthly data report of [archives.wtf ](https://archives.wtf/) for public reference.\n* All compiled datas are stored in [Nouns Archive's notion](https://voadz.notion.site/Nouns-Archive-da52f93301dd4ed59e5b876bd5151d93).\n\n### **RSS Feed**\n\nUtilising a simplified and condensed data feed can be more efficient than navigating through an entire website for the required information, making data feed crucial for individual use cases. That is why we're adding feed as a new feature, to make it easier for you to access the data you need and achieve your goals more efficiently.\n\nWe will provide a few types of feed for the main & sub-category pages ;\n  * RSS feed - /rss.xml\n  * Atom  feed - /atom.xml\n  * JSON feed - /feed.json\n\nThe data we have gathered can be utilised by everyone in the ecosystem for their own unique purposes. For instance, a mini companion app can directly use the JSON feed to list all proposals in NSFW Small Grants.\n\n### **Analytics**\n\nWe believe data transparency is important for the DAO & community. We are using **Vercel's Web Analytics** to get detailed insights. It provides in-depth information about your website's visitors, new metrics like top pages, top referrers, and demographics including information on countries, operating systems, and browsers.\n\nAs of *29th March - 20th April 2023,*\n\n* Visitors & Page Views\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8LkuQZn.png)\n\n* Panels\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zPo4dKf.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EUNHjX6.png)\n\n### **Sustainability Strategy**\n\nThe main intention of this project is to provide long-term benefits for Nouns. It serves as main archive center that provides wide media contents all over Nouns ecosystem for public reference. Once the open-source repository is public, we will be able to observe other NFT communities with active builders & projects and who benefits from Nouns' product to use it such as ;\n\n**Possible Candidates**\n* Nouns' extension & derivatives\n* Meebits\n* On-Chain Monkey\n* UMA\n* TinyDinos\n* Anata\n\n### **What's next?**\n\nWe certainly have long-term goals with few phases as we wish to accomplish them gradually. We attempt to avoid by highlighting all of our future objectives in one specific proposal as it sounds overly ambitious as we aim to underpromise and over-deliver. We believe that this will provide long term values and benefits to the DAO. It may not be a direct ROI.\n\nSome ideas worth looking at ;\n1. Preservation of archive material ( physical & digital )\n2. Nouns Archive '23 ( Limited physical edition )\n3. Publications - zines/quarterly\n4. Archive Data Request\n5. Ticketed exhibition of Nouns Archive materials ( ROI to DAO )\n\n---\n\n## **4. Deliverables**\n\nTo be delivered over the next 6 months ;\n* Maintaining & developing [archives.wtf](https://archives.wtf/) with all existing & incoming database of medias & arts in Nouns' ecosystem for the next 6 months.\n* Curated submission form & uploader. *(under Strategy)*\n* Toolings R&D. *(under Strategy)*\n* Nouns Archive repository.\n* RSS Feed\n* Daily nounish post in randomly manner on our social media, [Nouns Archive](https://twitter.com/NounsArchive).\n\n**Short-term checklist** *( to be archived )*\n\n* [Nouns Museum](https://twitter.com/thenounsmuseum)\n* [InternatioNouns](https://twitter.com/InternatioNouns)\n* Nouns AI's Contest\n* Messhup's Cover Art\n\n**Long-term checklist** *( to be archived )*\n\n* Prop House (Other houses, eg ; [Lil Nouns](https://prop.house/lil-nouns), [Nouns Japan](https://prop.house/nouns-japan), [Nouns Builder](https://prop.house/builder) etc)\n* Nouns On-Chain Props\n* NSFW\n* The Noun Square\n* Nouns World\n* Nouns' POAP Art\n\n---\n\n## **5.

      "description": "# Gnarly EP\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pW1Lxnj.png)\n\n**Gnarly EP** is a three track release by [Lil Bubble](https://twitter.com/thecryptobubble), an extremely nounish recording artist and Gnars DAO member. These original songs were commissioned [by Gnars for 3 ETH](https://snapshot.org/#/gnars.eth/proposal/0xbb73acb16a3b968a7cde352cf046b7d015b0dde0bce3a6d16355d28cf9d519e8) and this droposal marks our official [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/) release of the music and cover art. \n\n---\n\n## ⚡️ TLDR\n\n- Gnarly EP is a 3 track CC0 release\n- Extremely nounish originals by Lil Bubble\n- Attached txs deploy Zora timed open editions\n- Droposal only with no funding requested\n- Nouns get 10% of mint proceeds\n\n---\n\n## 👨‍🚀 Introduction\n\nLil Bubble is an established Web3-native character who has been releasing satirical songs and music videos for the community since 2019. His songs and remixes put a tongue-in-cheek spin on market events and have clocked **OVER 10 MILLION VIEWS**, adding to the cultural fabric of the space with a comedic blend of music, video and niche subject matter.\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/5EwyJEF.jpg)](https://twitter.com/TheCryptoBubble/status/1587404329262030849)\n\nHis engaged crypto-centric audience and alignment with Nounish values (using creative remixes and finely-crafted memes to contribute to Web3 culture) make Lil Bubble a great asset to Nouns. He has been a strong supporter and participant in the Nouns community - has featured Nouns in a previous music video, was one of the earliest members and supporters of Gnars DAO, has been a special guest in a number of Noun Square Twitter spaces, and is currently working on his own Nouns fork.\n\n## ⭐️ Previous Nounish Work\n\nLil Bubble featured Noun 189 and owner [Gami](https://gami.wtf) in a music video in August last year. A custom Noun skateboard was featured in the video which was shared widely throughout the community garnering over 370k impressions and 145k video views on Twitter alone.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5ZkITFM.jpg)\n\nLil Bubble grew up skateboarding and his continued support of Gnars DAO has helped us broaden our collector base. The three tracks produced for this EP have made a huge impact on our community, with \"Never Gonna Grow Up\" having already found its place as our anthem. \n\n## 🚀 Launch Plan\n\nEach of the three tracks are being released as timed open editions. You can [listen to them now](https://soundcloud.com/lilbubble/sets/gnarly-ep-1/s-hEnIvXqxQ1A) on SoundCloud by clicking the embedded players below. This droposal deploys the tracks and cover art to IPFS via Zora so that these music NFTs are ready for collecting.\n\n**Mint details:**\n\n- Start: Fri 28 Apr 2023 11pm UTC\n- Finish: Fri 5 May 2023 11pm UTC\n- Each track priced at 0.0069 ETH\n\n**Mint proceeds:**\n\n- Lil Bubble (40%)\n- Gnars treasury (40%)\n- Nouns treasury (10%)\n- Davin (10% agent fee)\n\n**Important links:**\n\n- Never Gonna Grow Up on Zora → [gna.rs/ep-one](https://gna.rs/ep-one)\n- Blast Off on Zora → [gna.rs/ep-two](https://gna.rs/ep-two)\n- Level Up on Zora → [gna.rs/ep-three](https://gna.rs/ep-three)\n- All 3 on That's Gnarly → [gna.rs/ep](https://gna.rs/ep)\n\n***Please note:** Mint proceeds split using a [0xSplits contract](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0x9AFa9B8A39b2f63316F815F00934838b7F51479C/). Links provided will be updated after execution of this droposal, once able to retrieve contract addresses and URLs. Admin set to gami.eth in case any post deployment fixes required. Owner will be set to gnars.eth following drop.*\n\n## 📝 Artist Remarks\n\nAs one of the first members of Gnars DAO it was fun to finally make some music for my favourite crew! There were a few elements to incorporate into the EP - Gnarly skate references, up-beat Nounish vibes, 8bit sound design, and Lil Bubble's signature crypto moonboy motif. I wanted each song to be a different style to keep things interesting. \n\n### Never Gonna Grow Up\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/iz4QGdx.jpg)](https://soundcloud.com/lilbubble/never-gonna-grow-up/s-tNxMPjzxvJN)\n\nThis is my interpretation of Gnars (and by extension Nouns). Skateboarding played a big role in my childhood so being able to re-ignite that passion with Gnars sparks all kinds of youthful nostalgia. Connecting with a new group of people in adulthood and engaging, building and creating together in new ways gives me that same feeling. I'm never gonna grow up!\n\n### Blast Off \n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/6sM9fSe.jpg)](https://soundcloud.com/lilbubble/blast-off/s-gIVZEDQB0wY)\n\nThis is probably my favourite instrumental on the EP. The trap beat and super simple 8bit-inspired synths are very 'Lil Bubble' and a pretty good glimpse at the direction I'm taking things with my original music moving forward. Lots of Gnars references in the lyrics!\n\n### Level Up\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/biGY1Ck.jpg)](https://soundcloud.com/lilbubble/level-up/s-rnUMscL3a6K)\n\nI wanted to step the energy up in the final track, moving in a slightly more tribal direction (Gnars is about extreme sports after all). More skate references in the lyrics - spot the shoutout to celebrity Gnars DAO member Bob Burnquist! I tied things together with plenty of digital glitches and some classic Lil Bubble trader stories. Regardless of which Web3 camp you sit in, you would have no doubt grown familiar with the market cycles and how they affect us all in one way or another. Trading aside, we should always be trying to level up and improve some area of our lives. Like my kickflips...\n\n## 🎁 Bonus Extras\n\n**Bonus 1:** Collectors who mint all three singles to complete the set will unlock a free to claim Collector's Edition EP. This is our way of saying an extra thank you to those who support Lil Bubble, the Nouns ecosystem, and nounish proliferation by the Gnars community. \n\nClaim details:\n\n- Start: Mon 8 May 2023 11pm UTC\n- Finish: Mon 15 May 2023 11pm UTC\n- Followed by public sale 0.024 ETH\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nNtGAwJ.png)\n\n**Pro tip:** As a DAO we’ve congregated around our new platform [That's Gnarly](https://thatsgnar.ly) to collect gnarly moments from creators in our community.  We’ve added a page that brings all 3 singles to one convenient minterface. To celebrate, we are also making these NFTs function as voting tokens.

      "description": "# The Nouns Mechanical Keyboard\n\n![teaser_MK](https://i.imgur.com/vcoWIpm.jpg)\n[Not a real design, for marketing only. Better design plan below.]\n\n---\n\nAs one of the primary means of interacting with our online world, keyboards are more than just a tool – they've become a personal expression. Until Neuralink becomes available, let's design a keyboard that we love to use every time!\n\nNextMech and I are excited to create a Nounish Mechanical Keyboard (MK) in collaboration with a top tier keyboard designers. With our internal MK knowledge and technical ability, we have planned a project that ultimately launches a Nouns sub-DAO for an enthusiastic subculture!\n\n### Overview\n\nOver the years, [an online subculture has emerged (partial MK ecosystem stats)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W-Io9Y8zjAwppzKt9UkSLhiGImyQgc8J9M1UUUvh6o/edit?usp=sharing) that cherishes their custom keyboards as works of art. This community has developed its own workflow called the group buy, where artists share designs for collectors to pre-order. After pooling the funds, the designer approaches a vendor to manufacture and deliver the product. Similar to web3, projects are decentralized across social media and different websites, [and they also have meetups around the world](https://twitter.com/search?q=%22mechanical%20keyboard%20meet%22&src=typed_query)! Using the existing manufacturing infrastructure, we can improve the UX by utilizing NFTs, DAOs, and open-source software, to bridge the two communities!\n\n![MK_meet](https://i.imgur.com/p8ph93F.jpg)\n[SF meet March 5th 2023 with a photoshoped Nouns MK - [original photo](https://twitter.com/villi/status/1632132746029182977)]\nOther meetups can be seen by searching for [\"mechanical keyboard meet\"](https://twitter.com/search?q=%22mechanical%20keyboard%20meet%22&src=typed_query).\n\n### Us\n\nNextMech and I (profish) began working on a project called Mechies which won a small prize in a 2022 Australian hackathon. We thought about MK NFTs in the form of generative art with manufacturable traits, DAOs as Vendors for group buys, hardware-embedded signatures, etc., to help improve the ecosystem. Then, at the beginning of this year, we were introduced to [Gami](https://twitter.com/0xigami) through a buildoors group in Australia. He told us about the profound model of Nouns, and it quickly became clear that a collaboration would help proliferate the brand and support the MK subculture. His tremendous support and knowledge has helped shape a sustainable plan for this project!\n\n### Nouns x MKs\n\nThe proliferation synergizes immediately with existing channels. For example, the Nouns Esports team could incorporate the keycaps in their battle stations which would reach gaming spectators - expression of support have been made for collaboration. Or, Nouns keycaps can be given as POAPs to hackathon participants and winners, Nouns keyboards would be taken to keyboard meet ups around the world, photos of Nouns keyboards and keycaps will be showcased on popular online forum with millions of visitors, and so on. But we plan to go further than these channels and use Zora's Nouns Builder to create a MK DAO and continue to support MK enthusiasts!\n\n### Future\n\nThe MK DAO and the general infrastructure supported by this grant can become a platform that improves group buys for designers and collectors. Designers can leverage NFTs to offer their work as mints. They can go further by turning their existing Discord communities into DAOs, where the community can have greater input and ownership in the products they purchase. Also, the collectors who mint these designs benefit from the social media integration of NFTs, for better showcasing of their collections. In fact, we have already begun curating this platform by commissioning different MK artists in the current process, with many more collaborations in the pipeline!\n\nAlso, a long-term experiment that we are considering involves addressing IP issues in the ecosystem. [Designers face a challenge in protecting their intellectual property (IP) when running group buys](https://www.theverge.com/22905351/mechanical-keyboard-keycap-clones-imitators-knockoffs-olivia-biip). While stopping counterfeits for keycaps and general products is very difficult, authenticating the keyboards may be feasible. By using [VIA, an open-source software integrated with all keyboards](https://www.caniusevia.com/) and working with manufacturers, we could link keyboards to NFTs for potentially increasing their social and monetary value for collectors.\n\n### Summary Plan\n\nWe will work with a top tier MK designer and manufacture the keyboards for the NFT minters. We aim to sell and manufacture 1-2k units with a unique marketing strategy that involves selling keycaps of various sorts to complement the keyboard. This provides an incentive for us to proliferate Nouns, reduce prices and gather foundational members for the MK DAO!\n\nFinally, the entirety of this project will be a great example of real-world adoption for NFTs, especially with the new [EIPs for physical NFTs](https://medium.com/@ABCDE.com/abcde-after-studying-all-eips-we-summarized-9-future-directions-of-nfts-648c11f16a4f). It will be a major win for Nouns to be early and supportive of a devoted subculture that is growing! Take, for example, the subscriber count for the /r/MechanicalKeyboards subreddit:\n![MK_subreddit_stats](https://i.imgur.com/ynIRz2l.png)\n[Here is a small data set that we have gathered on the ecosystem to provide more context.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W-Io9Y8zjAwppzKt9UkSLhiGImyQgc8J9M1UUUvh6o/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**With that said, here is a simple cost breakdown to make it all possible. We have already begun tracking expenses in our Notion and will continue to do so for the rest of the project. If there is a surplus we will allocate to other productive activities that further the project. More detailed breakdown and Q&A at the end:**\n\n- 52 ETH for manufacturing setup of however many mints but a guaranteed amount of 260 units including buffer, prototypes and YouTuber review units. With couple hundred spare keycap sets.\n- 10 ETH for assembling (80+ hours of labor), storage until redemption and safe high priority shipping.\n- 21.69 ETH for marketing of digital and physical assets including keycap airdrops of various different types.\n- 35 ETH for team and contractors, managing production, technical, graphics and starting/supporting the MK DAO.\n\n**Total - 118.69 ETH**\n\n---\n---\n## Detailed Plan\nCustom keyboard manufacturing involves two main components: the case and keycap set. Switches and other components are also significant, but they are less customizable; therefore, we will simply use enthusiast-grade products. For a more detailed overview of mechanical keyboards, [check out this intro made by NextMech](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gRH83pF1RBXW6Eve_OLC9Fb7hAlxQQEP/view?usp=sharing).\n\nTo start, a designer will incorporate the Nouns brand into the keyboard canvas. We are considering a collaboration with several designer who can create an aesthetic Nouns-themed keyboard. These designers can combine the MK culture and Nouns brand for a pleasing design. These include [BIIP](https://instagram.com/biipmk), [NoPunIn10Did](https://nopunin10did.com/kat-napoleonic/), [sourmk](https://www.instagram.com/sourmk), pikku-allu, dededecline who would be able to combine different themes into their work. Also, a design by a top artist plays a major role for introducing Nouns to the MK community, ensuring a high-quality product that enthusiasts will enjoy. Here are some of the works by the mentioned designers:\n\n![biip_dots](https://i.imgur.com/6WupSai.jpg)\n[BIIP Dots]\n![Pikku_allu](https://i.imgur.com/EsoOGd7.jpg)\n[Pikku Allu Symbiote]\n![nopunin10did](https://i.imgur.com/mNWDioS.jpg)\n[nopunin10did DSS Late Harvet]\n![sourmk_dandy](https://i.imgur.com/fJDs1nY.jpg)\n[Sourmk Dandy]\n\nFor manufacturing, our first choice is a company that builds based on their available catalog of cases and can also assist with packaging and shipping. However, for a better quality design, we are prepared to carry out a more bespoke model by working with different suppliers. NextMech has experience with both approaches and after accounting for trade-offs and constraints, we are confident on delivering a high quality product. The bespoke approach will start at a higher unit cost, but it's still within the financial plan. Also, it's well worth trading off additional costs for a better design!\n\nAfter finalizing the design, we will begin reviewing prototypes from the manufacturer(s) to confirm the colors and build quality. This will give us the confidence to replicate the design as an NFT, one that will be minted through after a project update. The mint will be priced at approximately 0.3-0.4 ETH depending on final unit cost and ETH price, with a discount for Nouns holders which brings price to near cost. It will have boolean-based redemption on [nouns.mk](https://nouns.MK) since we don't want to burn the NFT so that it can be shared online, and also allows for over the air updates through VIA software.\n\nPrior to and during the minting of the NFTs, we will launch marketing efforts to increase the visibility of the project. Proliferating the brand through community activity which also aligns with our incentive to reduce unit costs. A portion of the mint will be used to help start the MK DAO built using Zora's Noun Builder. We will support the MK DAO by managing further collaboration and manufacturing processes. Also, in addition to the daily auctions for the DAO, people who participated in the physical marketing events will gain access some access to the DAO.\n\nYou can start participating by [minting the momento NFT](https://zora.co/collections/0xbe11ce87505d41b6848f37cba26820d89b060a3e) where the glasses will be [magnetic](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cp0Q-juJ-_Y/?img_index=1)! Some participants will win this with their keyboard!\n[![noun_keycap_board](https://i.imgur.com/06G1uuC.png)](https://zora.co/collections/0xbe11ce87505d41b6848f37cba26820d89b060a3e)\n\nThe physical marketing is in the style of MK communities, which will be on in addition to the digital media marketing. We are working on various exciting strategies for minters; some include resin keycaps with 3D Nouns characters inside, two piece magnetic and modular keycaps, novelty keycaps with Nouns themes, high-quality metallic keycaps, a fully custom 1/1 keyboard made for auction, hackathon POAP keycaps redeemed in person and more MK designer and influencer collaborations! These will have various pricing mechanisms to maximize accessibility for collectors and start the MK DAO.\n\nHere are some examples (not a real design) of a Nouns keycap NFT for physical marketing, which can be redeemed in the same way as the main keyboard NFT. It's a great addition to the custom keyboard once it arrives, or it allows MK enthusiasts to join the community with their existing keyboard!\n\n![noun_keycap_board](https://i.imgur.com/xON1kBh.jpg)\n![noun_keycap_board](https://i.imgur.com/FFxttkm.png)\n[Not a real design, for conceptualization of single keycap only - by boardbay]\n\nOnce manufacturing, assembly, and quality testing are complete, the NFTs can be redeemed. They will be stored with a distributor or manufacturer and can be redeemed at any time. It is possible to sell the NFTs prior to redeeming them. \n\n### Current Progress\nAll progress will be made public on our Notion page, where we keep info that is up to date. Here are some highlights from the current progress:\n- Talking to two manufacturers and shared general idea to confirm production and timeline feasibility.\n- In contact with mentioned designers and discussing collaboration terms.\n- Quotes and plans on keycap marketing with various designers.\n- Registered [Nouns.mk](http://Nouns.mk), twitter account [@nounsmk](https://twitter.com/nounsmk), [nounsmk.eth](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth%3A0x144975eEc9674fd0Af3d6F3FBa8D660879cE3881) and nounsmkdao.eth.\n- Project outline and public workspace for the entirety of the project, with more details to be added as the project progresses.\n\n## Team and our MKs!\n**[Profish](https://twitter.com/profishcrypto) (product)**: My past experience is software engineering work for crypto trading companies and tokenomic simulations in cadCAD. Also, as part of the DAO Under community, I've project managed the build of a DAO framework to support crypto builders in Australia.\n\n**[NextMech](https://instagram.com/next.mech) (MK expert)**: Michael runs a boutique custom MK business and has a deep understanding of the industry. Additionally, as a full-stack developer, he can effectively plan with the constraints of a physical NFT projects!\n\nHelping us will be **Joy Chiang (artist)**: She has helped some of the most successful NFT projects in Australia and has a family of MK enthusiasts!\n\n![team-MK](https://i.imgur.com/nEN1vIF.jpg)\n\n## Detailed Phases (8-12 months)\n\nThese are the major phases in the project and the estimated timeline. The building and marketing phase will be ongoing as the keycaps are mini NFT projects for the community. [Here is an early view of the timeline in our Notion, we will make it more accurate as we progress through the stages.](https://www.notion.so/5046938e65264b02b9d86c117289b98e).\n\n### Phase 1: Design\n- Start momento manufacturing for two piece magnetic keycap\n- Start commissions on physical marketing assets (1/1 keyboards, keycaps, NFC keycap, designer collab, keyboard head nouns for MK DAO, etc.)\n- Work with designer to finalize design (also communicating with manufacturer for feasibility)\n- Replicate keyboard design as an NFT\n- Update [Nouns.mk](http://Nouns.MK) with final design and soft launch\n- Update task board and add more detailed overview given new information\n\n### Phase 2: Marketing\n\n- Release mint of redeemable keyboard NFT\n- Digital marketing assets based on keyboard design\n- Continuation of physical marketing\n- Gather designers and collectors for MK DAO\n\n### Phase 3: Build\n\n- [Nouns.mk](http://Nouns.MK) update for redemption process and collection view\n- Ongoing build of NFT smart contract for physical marketing assets\n- Beginning MK DAO design and implementation for existing community\n- Exploring VIA experiment for 1/1 keyboard\n\n### Phase 4: Delivery\n\n- Manufactured, packaged and begin shipping for redemption\n- Online launch events and plan in person launch event\n- Small gatherings at existing MK meetups and crypto conferences\n- Launching MK DAO\n\n![timeline](https://i.imgur.com/Ox4IW82.png)\n\n\n## Detailed Costs (8-12 month project)\n\nThese are the costs with a small margin of error to account for challenges that arise during physical goods manufacturing. But we aim to be efficient and transparent with the budget in our Notion. The ETH is transferred to mechies.eth which has 3/4 threshold including Profish, NextMech, Zaak (from Zora) and Gami.\n\n### Manufacturing - 52 ETH\n\n- Tooling setup for a minimum of 200 units at approx. 400 USD depending on design complexity. Aiming for 1-2k units to reduce unit cost to 300.\n- 100-200 keycap sets only for future sale.\n- 15% supply buffer for quality control issues (but they will be available for selling when we see that there are no issues with the supply)\n- 4 units for prototypes 0.7 ETH each (including shipping)\n- Tooling setup for manufacturing (case layout, colours, materials, testing, handling supply chain, etc)\n- Post manufacturing processes such as etching, quality checks, and assembling\n- Remaining parts such as PCBs, switches, frames, screws, badges, etc.\n\n### Delivery - 10 ETH\n\n- Assembling and Packaging\n- Storing in warehouse until shipment\n- Shipping with insurance (priority DHL for example) in case of damages or lost property so we can compensate the NFT holder or retry\n\n### Marketing - 21.69 ETH\n\n- Digital assets such as videos, gifs, 3D renders for social media\n- Manufacturing cost of physical marketing assets for give away and raffles\n    - 100 to 200 super custom keycaps: 3D resin, 2 piece keycaps, handmade interactive keycaps, etc.\n    - 400 to 600 Artisan keycaps: basic metallic, infill metallic, plastic, basic resin, CNC etc.\n    - 1/1 fully custom keyboard to be auctioned\n    - Simple keycaps and NFC chipped keycaps as POAPs for hackathons\n    - Novelty keys for the main keycap set\n- Marketing units sent to YouTube and twitch influencers for review\n- Misc: post manufacturing skins, digital art commission, social media posts, etc.\n- Hosting launch event and keyboard meetups \n\n### Team - 35 ETH\n\n- 16 ETH - Managing the project across manufacturing, marketing, tech, admin, community,  subcontractors, delivery, etc.\n- 7 ETH - Website development and tech infrastructure for minting and collecting, open source forks such as Builder DAO and VIA\n- 6 ETH - Designer commissions for MK design and manufacturing spec (CAD files)\n- 4 ETH - graphics, branding assets and website design \n- 2 ETH - misc fees such as gas, spreads, SAAS services, smart contracts, retro costs etc.\n\n**Total - 118.69 ETH**\n\n![MK_heads](https://i.imgur.com/KFLtMUX.png)\n[potential auction art for MK DAO - by instagram@keebpixel artist]\n\n\n## Short Q&A\n\n- **How much is the NFT mint?** Approximately 0.3-0.4 ETH. Nouns holders will receive a discount which brings the price close to cost. We aim to make it affordable by keeping manufacturing reasonable and reduce margin by increasing units. The marketing assets will vary in the form of free, free mint-to-win, at cost, at profit, auctions, free scan to keep and more.\n- **How expensive are MKs?** Custom mechanical keyboards by reputable designers can go upwards of 800-1000 USD. Production is constrained due to the tooling overhaul process, which makes the product rare. Also, NFT feature on top add to that value as we experiment with VIA.\n- **How does the redemption work?** Sharing pictures of MKs online is important, and having an NFT to share is even better. Once you redeem, the NFT becomes non-transferable. Also, it allows for over the air updates through the VIA software for lighting, macros, sounds, etc.\n- **Will the keyboards be assembled?** It is common for the manufacturer to send unassembled keyboards. Assembly is quite easy, as all the components are plug-ins, so if they don't assemble it, we will either work with a distributor or assemble them ourselves. We are even considering an option where the NFT holder can chose between these two options, since the assembling process is part of the experience. However, it's too early to tell if that will be possible.\n- **How long does it take to deliver?** Usually around 10-12 months from the proposal passing to delivery. Keycap sets can sometimes take up to 3 years to deliver, but we are going to make sure that doesn't happen. Also, we think we can shorten this time for future iterations in the MK DAO.\n- **How big is the MK community?** You'd be surprised who likes MK since it doesn't come up in conversation. The forums and Discord servers of designers are similar to or, bigger in size and activity compared to crypto communities. Although, it is pretty scattered online, but I have made a [spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W-Io9Y8zjAwppzKt9UkSLhiGImyQgc8J9M1UUUvh6o/edit?usp=sharing) to provide some context.\n- **Will there be a sub DAO?** We aim to start one, since there is so much you can do as a community. For example, new keycap styles come out every year, so the DAO can continue commissioning collabs with any theme. We will airdrop supporters, including Nouns to join the MK DAO.\n\n![nouns_MK_samples](https://i.imgur.com/N25XTBo.png)\n[illustration renders of keyboard designs]\n\n---\n---\n#### Relevant links\n\n- Project Notion: [https://mechies.notion.site/Enter](https://mechies.notion.site/Enter-e9a095646e2b49978751c10df85aa12a)\n- Nouns MK site: [nouns.mk](http://Nouns.MK)\n- Nouns MK twitter: [twitter.com/nounsmk](https://twitter.com/nounsmk)\n- Twitter: [twitter.com/mechiesnft](https://twitter.com/mechiesnft)\n- Next.Mech: [instagram.com/next.mech/](https://www.instagram.com/next.mech/)\n- Intro to Mechanical Keyboards: [drive.google.com/file/d/mk_intro](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gRH83pF1RBXW6Eve_OLC9Fb7hAlxQQEP/view?usp=sharing)\n- Small view of the MK landscape: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/mk_eco_data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W-Io9Y8zjAwppzKt9UkSLhiGImyQgc8J9M1UUUvh6o/edit?usp=sharing)\n- Twitter search for Mechanical Keyboard Meetups: [meetup tweets](https://twitter.com/search?q=%22mechanical%20keyboard%20meet%22&src=typed_query)\n\n![nouns_MK_samples](https://i.imgur.com/JJtVLr3.png)\n[illustration render of keyboard components]",

I don't want to see Noggles slapped on a keyboard - I want to see innovation, a high quality keyboard that authentically captures the attention of everyone interested in MK.\n\n- consider further integration with and support of VIA.

The visual concepts also looked great and got me excited for an eventual finished project.\nThat being said, there are a few key issues with this proposal that pushed me to vote against.\n\nFirstly, the team is proposing for the DAO to pay for all the manufacturing costs and the team's compensation. On top of that, they are receiving all the proceeds from the NFT sales. Seems we are double spending here. This needs to be further clarified. \nAlso, it would've been great to see a % of the sales being returned back to the treasury.\n\nSecondly, I would have liked to see more on proliferation. The keyboards themselves will most likely be sold to people already in the ecosystem. So there needs to be some work done outside of the sales of the keyboards. This possibly comes in how exactly the subDAO will operate and how It can push nounish ideas forward. In general I believe more things should be explored on this front.\n\nThis is definitely an interesting concept, I would be open to a revised version of this prop.\n\n",

Once the drop is complete, minters authenticate through a Japanese gameshow style experience.\n\n![](https://zora-prod.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafybeifpissycinwptwf7iwmrkffiamidofp66l6snql5zjo33nsbks42i)\n\nWhat we have built to power Forgeries is open source and free to use. Anyone can deploy their own contracts from Omega to create unique experiences. Everything is fair, transparent and verifiably random thanks to [Chainlink VRF](https://chain.link/vrf)!\n\n## 📺 Omega\n\nAn extensive [public audit contest](https://code4rena.com/contests/2022-12-forgeries-contest) was completed on code4rena, with 77 auditors earning their share of a 36,500 USDC prize pool. Since then we’ve implemented patches for all vulnerabilities found, made various optimisations and prepared the protocol for mainnet. All of the code is open source and can be found in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/0xigami/forgeries-contracts).\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/V4pBraW.jpg)\n](https://twitter.com/defdao/status/1626655069906128896)\n\nOur vision is a multiplayer future for crypto and we firmly believe NFTs are the building blocks. By providing public goods infrastructure to the community we can empower developers, artists, collectors, projects and DAOs to unlock a new design space for creative onchain experiences. \n\n## 💾 C:ollab \n\nWe are fostering a supportive community around Omega and look forward to helping fund the creation of new experiences. Prop House infinite rounds will provide the ideal platform, while our editions will function well as voting tokens. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CnCF3Xy.jpg)\n\n[Permissionless collabs](https://permissionlesscollabs.com) (if you're installed, you're in) and in future, perhaps, a nounish DAO to serve as the steward of our new protocol. But first there are various upgrades and extensions we have planned to make the system as trustless as possible. \n\n## 🕹 Loading...\n\nWe've been working on some very nounish expansion packs for Omega and would love if nounsfolk came to explore with us.

      "description": "# Nouns x W3BSTOCK in NOUN YORK CITY!!!!\n\n### Preface\nI'm sponsoring this prop because I believe in the initiative, but have no involvement beyond sponsorship. Please direct any questions and conversation to the builders proposing - Brian and Bloomz.\n\n\n## TLDR \n\nWe're requesting 10 ETH to make Nouns DAO a Title Partner of W3BSTOCK NYC, a global live entertainment consortium that empowers artists and revolutionizes the music industry using blockchain technology. By partnering with W3BSTOCK, Nouns DAO will gain significant exposure and align itself with the top-tier global web3 music and arts ecosystem, which is growing rapidly in New York City. The partnership will involve Noun-focused activations, merchandise, and branding throughout the event, targeting a diverse audience of over 1,500 attendees, and providing long-term value to the Nouns community.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZaAkO29.jpg)\n\n## Intro\n\nNOUN YORK CITY 2023!!!\n\nGM Fellow Nouners! \n\nAt W3BSTOCK, our core mission is to proliferate live music and beautiful art into a wider consciousness while providing creators with the tools to pave a more equitable music industry. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, we are spreading education around these tools and showing creators how to drive new forms of revenue, fan engagement, and artistic expression. We believe that by empowering artists, we empower the world, disrupting the outdated music industry and creating a more vibrant and equitable future for all involved. We would LOVE for the Nouns DAO to join us on this exciting journey to revolutionize the world of music and art.\n\nWe are a NYC-based, global live entertainment consortium powering the decentralized music industry, with a core team from diverse live entertainment production entities like Brooklyn Bowl, Relix Magazine, The Capitol Theatre, Lockn' Music Festival, Central Park Summerstage and Universal Music and from artistic and musical members of bluechip NFT communities like the Bored Ape Yacht Club, Crypto Punks (Spottie Wifi is in the DAO), Gutter Cat Gang, Nouns, Lil Nouns, The Visitors, The Alien Boy, and many more. Our organization integrates best-in-class web3 tools and communities to produce concerts, music festivals and other meaningful, memorable experiences in real life, all doubled in the metaverse, all framed around a global mission to fix the live music industry through blockchain to create a better future for creators, venues, event organizers and fans. \n\nFollowing the successful Nouns activations at W3BSTOCK Miami on December 1st, 2022 and the W3BSTOCK x Lil Nouns Denver party on March 4th, 2023. We now have the opportunity for Nouns to make a lasting impression within the W3BSTOCK live music and arts ecosystem, which will reverberate across the thriving New York City web3 community in the artistic and musical epicenter of NFT.NYC and beyond. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Y0Cyr22.jpg)\n\n## Event \n\nW3BSTOCK will kick off NFT.NYC this year on the eve of the conference, Tuesday, April 11th with a massive event bringing together over 40 leading music acts from the web3 music ecosystem like Dyl, Rae Isla, Domino, Violetta Zironi, Nifty Sax, The CART3L, Fifi Rong, Jadyn Violet, and Taylor Alexander, and over 30 high profile NFT tastemakers like Dave Krugman / ALLSHIPS, KYD Labs, Aptos, Metasill, Tokenprooof, and many more - This is the biggest lineup of web3 artists playing a single stage in history and we have the opportunity to get the Nouns DAO front and center of not only the NYC event, but the big picture mission at the core of W3BSTOCK: To proliferate live music and beautiful art into a wider consciousness.\n\nW3BSTOCK was hands down the most popular music and art event the day before NFT NYC last year and I expect this year will be no different. With an expected attendance of over 30,000 attendees at NFT.NYC this year, W3BSTOCK realistically projects an attendance of over 1,500 educated, diverse attendees for their event, including in-person attendees and metaverse attendees with organic social media impressions exceeding 20,000. \n\n**Note:** the vast majority of the NYC web3 music community are NOT widely aware of the Nouns DAO and what we are doing - hence the opportunity.\n\nThis is an unprecedented opportunity to align the Nouns community with the top tier global web3 music and arts ecosystem that is emerging from New York and rapidly spreading around the world. We will onboard new community members from the W3BSTOCK music and art community into the Nouns DAO, and we will ensure that the Nouns are tethered inextricably to the paradigm shift that is just beginning for artists and creators. \n\nThis is a different type of NFT event. It is solely focused on live music, beautiful performances, and interactive art activations, rather than a dry panel of speakers or a bunch of speculative crypto bros. \n\nW3BSTOCK has already proliferated incredible web3-enabled music and arts programming in New York, Las Vegas, Miami and London, with forthcoming parties coming up at Bitcoin 2022 in May and at W3BSTOCK Sydney in August. For this reason, I would like Nouns to have a leading presence at this event, so that the Nouns will continue to be a leading cultural tastemaker in this good-to-grey web3 music ecosystem over the long term.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7JLOGHx.jpg)\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Rq4b0gB.jpg)\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/P8n3obSl.jpg)\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QpTuXL3l.png)\n\n\n## Description\n\nWe are requesting 10 ETH for **Nouns** to become a **Title Partner** of W3BSTOCK NYC with a complete Nounish takeover of the entire event, including a fully Nounish Photo Booth with a direct social media integration. We will also get Noggles on leading web3 music influencers like Dyl, Violetta Zironi, Rae Isla, and more, on the eve of the conference so they can rock them for the remainder of NFT week and aid in the cultural Nouns proliferation. This will make a large splash and kick off a week of Nounish proliferation at NFT NYC and will also generate loads of awareness for Nouns DAO and their mission.\n\nThe funding breakdown will be as follows:\n\n10 ETH For Title Partnership that will get us:\n* Premiere, exclusive sponsorship of the event which would make it the official Nouns NFT NYC kickoff event\n*  20’x20’ Official Tastemaker IRL Vendor Booth, placed prominently at the main entrance to the event with 2 dedicated 33” Metasill screen and projector to display Nouns NFTs at the front and center of the event\n*   Allow Nouns to curate parts of the event **designing high end fabricated scenes for the photo booth and other pop up activations** at areas all across the event venue\n*   A Nounish photo booth with direct social media integration and a pre-made tweet / IG template that has Nouns tagged. We will offer a free NFT claim to anyone who posts a Nounish photo and tags the Nouns to incentivize an online network effect, and we will offer future utility to these holders at future events within the music and arts web3 ecosystem\n*    100 comps for Nouns holders - which grants access to the immersive VIP Groove Room, open bar, and on site swag and other giveaways\n* Nouns featured with top, premiere placement on invite and promo materials \n* Nouns featured prominently in signage at the event\n* Nouns inspired specialty cocktail on bar menu\n* Branding and link to Nouns.wtf in the Metaverse livestream component of the event\n* Branding across social assets\n* Branding on emails linked to the event\n\n* 50 custom Nouns x W3BSTOCK t-shirts to be given away to holders (first come, first served)\n* 8’ x 8’ Nouns @ W3BSTOCK Step-and-Repeat \n* 47” x 81” Nouns Retractable Banner (which we will carry around and display at multiple events throughout NFT NYC) \n* Noggles for swag bag and for handing out across NFT NYC \n* W3BSTOCK-included VIP table for Nouns community at Nolcha Shows x Crypto Punks event with 3,000 attendees on Weds, April 12th\n* A **guaranteed Nounish activation at the W3BSTOCK x Nolcha Shows** party at the SLS South Beach during Bitcoin 2023 on May 25\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wUNMk3p.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RDfdQaR.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NOT5FzY.jpg)\n\n## ROI To The DAO:\n\nI will show the DAO several returns on investment from this activation from financial, to brand awareness, to growth marketing. I will be collecting data via POAP mints, distributed merch to holders, and social media impressions. We will keep a thorough list of tags on every social platform, Nouns.wtf and nouns.wft link visits during the week, and will provide a full write-up on all of the nounish interactions with artists and creators and the W3BSTOCK event and across NFT NYC. \n\nI will provide a total of **3 reports to the DAO**. The reports will provide **follow up analytics after 7 days, 30 days and 90 days**. The stats I will be tracking are:\n\n•**Branding and proliferation** of Noggles all across NFT.NYC with an estimated 20,000 organic social impressions\n• **Hundreds of photos** of W3BSTOCK and Nouns and other nounish people at the step-and-repeat including leading web3 music and cultural influencers\n• **Website Traffic** to Nouns.wtf \n• **Purchases** - We will have a number of POAP kiosks throughout the event where attendees will mint our Nouns @ W3BSTOCK NFT NYC POAP. Through this, we will have a list of wallet addresses that I will then check those addresses at the 7 day, 30 day and 90 day checkpoints to see if any of those wallet addresses now own a Noun (purchased after the event date)\n• **Photos** either tagging Lil Nouns or Nouns and/or containing Noggles, pulled from every social media platform at 30, 90 and 180s out from the event.\n• **Aggregated brand impressions** from all social media, web visits and NFT purchases post event at each checkpoint\n\nBy proliferating Nouns and Lil Nouns at W3BSTOCK Miami and also our collab Denver event, and also knowing all about W3BSTOCK last NYC event at the same venue, I have been able to see first hand how to best proliferate the nounish brands among the W3BSTOCK arts and music ecosystem. The biggest impacts include:\n\n• **Interactive art**, screens and live minting POAP experiences, and step-and-repeat activations\n• **A strong presence** at the event with a premium booth & Noun maxis to chat with & answer questions\n• **Live music** - This has been oft overlooked in building the Nouns communities and I believe we have massively untapped awareness within the thriving web3 NYC music and arts web3 scene - This proposal will instantly fix that\n• **Branded tote gift bags** handed out to holders \n• **Stickers** - people love collecting stickers and we saw tons of them up around various places in Miami and Denver\n• **T-shirts** - Branded W3BSTOCK x Nouns t-shirts turn attendees into marketing evangelists, and people who come to events and have a great time (like, all of them) are happy to wear merch around to other events at conferences and also post on social media  \n\nIf this proposal is funded we will officially be partnering with the first-to-market and leading web3 music and arts ecosystem which is thriving in New York City. This will allow allow for nounish proliferation over an entire week, not only in W3BSTOCK’s live music and arts ecosystem, but in and around the largest NFT conference in the entire world, in the greatest city in the world, **NOUN YORK CITY!!!!**\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe music industry has long been plagued by problems that hurt artists and fans, and this is the most ripe space for blockchain disruption, and this particular use case and demographic has been largely overlooked by the Nouns DAO .... until now. \n\nWe believe that blockchain technology is poised to create a more equitable future for artists, fans, and industry professionals alike. By leveraging the power of blockchain, we're able to provide a platform that enables direct artist-to-fan engagement and fair revenue distribution, cutting out middlemen and gatekeepers who have historically taken a large chunk of the profits. Our organization also provides creators with new ways to monetize their work, such as through NFTs and fan token offerings, creating new forms of revenue streams that were previously unavailable.\n\nLike the Nouns, at W3BSTOCK, we're not just speculating about the possibilities of blockchain technology - we're making it a reality. This is why we believe that a partnership like this would represent such a mutual value and bear very long term fruit for the Nouns and independent creators across the globe. \n\nI believe that one of the core focuses in our shared goal of proliferation the Nouns DAO should be empowering creators, and what better way than to proliferate Nouns to artists and musicians? These are the truest arbiters of culture. Musicians and artists say what is cool, they define culture. We get leading web3 artists and musicians rocking the Nouns brand ... and the world will follow. \n\nBy getting involved with W3BSTOCK, we'll be at the forefront of a music, art, and creator revolution, disrupting the outmoded music industry and creating a more equitable future for all involved. \n\nThank you for considering this proposal, and here's to a brighter future for music, art and the world!\n\n## Team \n\n* **Brian Stollery** - Hi!

          "reason": "Imagine a world where voting does not exist. In this world, we would have no need for rules or principles. But in our world, voting is a reality. So we have a simple rule: we only vote against. We use a “Squad Vote” for each proposal. If more people vote against than vote for or abstain, we vote against on-chain. Otherwise, we abstain. This is our rule.\n\nAccording to the “squad vote” result for proposal 258, which is 0 for, 30 against and 0 abstain, we choose to vote against.The viewpoints of our different members are as follows (source not listed):\n\nOpinions opposing this proposal:\n1. This is not community building. It's merely Satori and Bixbite doing business with Nouns, a business that is not advantageous for Nouns.\n2. Satori and Bixbite's remarks in the Jungle channel, such as \"Lil Nouns is cheap so I gave them a cheap\" and \"Lil Nouns is a toxic environment,\" further convince me that they do not understand the spirit of the community. They display arrogance toward the individual community members, treating DAOs and communities as cold numbers. This is the worst and most repulsive proposal and proposers I have encountered.\n3. NounsDAO needs to operate in a community-driven manner, incubating more teams that understand and love the Nounish spirit. Today, NounsDAO has many teams that both love Nouns and can produce outstanding work. Yet, W3BSTOCK only seeks to be an outsourcing team, proposing a disadvantageous business deal.\n4. I will continue to oppose such activities that use exposure as a gimmick. The traditional growth model that relies on increased exposure is effective because it has a unified company and growth system behind it. However, the conversion rate of each aspect of this growth method would plummet in NounsDAO, rendering it ineffective. NounsDAO's growth engine comes from numerous small teams that love Nouns and have comprehensive capabilities, as well as the establishment of specific social relationships.\n5. Nouns may no longer need this type of exposure.\n\nSupporting views on the proposal:\n1. A dedicated event organizer possesses sufficient professionalism.\n2. They have participated in the Lilnouns community and observed the Nouns community. Although they mayn't to adapt, they have their own understanding of decentralized governance issues.\n\nPoints of uncertainty include:\n1. Bitcoin has never rejected anyone. Conflicts between native and external teams can be observed in various projects. On one hand, I have seen cases where bringing in professionals to solve problems for projects ended poorly. Native teams must build every module from scratch, and there are no shortcuts. On the other hand, the MakerDAO model shows that, despite severe conflicts between native and external teams, they are not mutually exclusive at the protocol level. Instead, they should be embraced by the protocol.",

      "description": "# Nouns Wallet Service\n\n![Group 16.png](https://i.postimg.cc/pTxFF6Q9/Group-16.png)\n\n***************special thanks to the Lil Nouns for the help in shaping this proposal and for putting it onchain***************\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nA new Nouns service to place NFTs in Apple & Google Wallets, unlocking the ability for communities to send push notifications to token holders and for simple event token gating\n\n- A new communication layer for token-based communities.\n- Tooling that makes web3 more understandable to the mainstream.\n- A free tool, available to every web3 community — where every new community that uses the tool proliferates the noggles and their association with building exceptional public infrastructure.\n\n**About us**\n\nWe’re good at making stuff go mainstream & viral – like our website [Poolsuite.net](http://poolsuite.net), our music app [Poolsuite FM](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/poolsuite-fm/id1514817810), our sunscreen co [Vacation®](https://twitter.com/marty/status/1616852882480840709?s=20), and our [Palm Report](https://www.palm.report/) newsletter which is read by over 70,000 people every week. At Poolsuite, we’re a small team of passionate builders with a desire to create beautiful internet products, and we’re keen to understand the appetite within the Nouns community to collaborate. While we don’t yet have a treasury that enables us to focus our primary efforts on public goods, we can bring our deep understanding of consumer products and expertise in crafting rich brand worlds to the Nouns ecosystem. In the same way we have begun collaborating with major designer brands (alpha soon) we want to do the same within web3, and we see Nouns as one the most actively engaged and innovative communities in the space, uniquely positioned for us to work with on wonderfully designed products that push forward web3 adoption alongside the combined awareness of our brands.\n\n**INTRODUCING NOUNS WALLET SERVICE**\n\n---\n\nNouns Wallet Service would allow any user to add **any NFT** (or ERC-20) into their Apple/Android wallet — the same place they keep their loyalty cards, boarding passes, and credit cards — unlocking the ability for web3 communities to send push notifications to token holders and a wealth of powerful future use cases. This tool would be usable by any Ethereum based DAO/NFT collection. \n\n![Screenshot 2023-01-09 at 10.20.37 PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/XJ8yckxs/Screenshot-2023-01-09-at-10-20-37-PM.png)\n\n**Why?**\n\n- In the mainstream view, NFTs are still mostly seen as investment assets but placing NFTs side by side with loyalty cards and boarding passes tangibly demonstrates that they offer much more and can unlock a variety of experiences. To bring the next wave of mainstream users to web3, we need tools that make the web3 experience as friendly as web2.\n- There's an engagement problem in web3; its incredibly hard to communicate with token holders. We've seen this first hand fighting our way to the top of the Twitter feed to notify our [Executive Members](https://members.poolsuite.net/) of new drops. A lot of communities are building their own apps to try to solve this engagement challenge but not every project needs an app.\n- The shutdown of the Nouns Discord opened the door for reimagining what the communication and social layers can look like for decentralized communities. Nouns communications are currently fragmented. And while there are various [chat groups](https://nouns.center/groups), [newsletters](https://nouns.substack.com/), and Twitter accounts, there is no simple real-time communication layer that is gaining significant traction.\n\n****************************Considerations****************************\n\n- Nouns Wallet Service would be a free tool, available to every web3 community.\n- Every new community that uses the tool would proliferate the noggles and their association with building public web3 infrastructure. Nouns Wallet Service would launch as “Nouns Wallet Service public infrastructure by Nouns DAO”, similar to [Prop House](https://prop.house/), [Nouns Builder](https://nouns.build/), [Voters.wtf](https://www.voters.wtf/nouns).\n- Unlike with mobile apps, push notifications are enabled by default with wallet passes, meaning no additional opt-in is required.\n- Last year we built an early version of Wallet Service for our Executive Members that generated a ton of excitement within our community, and we’re confident we can develop this into a fully-packaged service that works incredibly well for both centralized and decentralized communities.\n- We’ve passed Lil Nouns prop lot with 687 upvotes (9% consensus) – s/o Lil Nouns community for feedback, helping us shape up this proposal, and for putting this proposal onchain.\n\n**Funding Request**\n\nWe’re asking for 120 ETH to design and build Nouns Wallet Service including 1 year of maintenance from our team. To bring the next wave of mainstream users to web3, we need tools that make the web3 experience as friendly as web2 – and we believe these tools should be built as public infrastructure, freely available for all DAOs. The funding would go towards:\n\n- **Web App** – Designing & building a beautiful interactive web app where users will be able to connect wallet and select which NFTs to add to their mobile wallet (on desktop: scan QR, on mobile: download natively). We’ll design this interface alongside the Nouns community to reach an exceptional execution of the Nouns brand.\n- **Token Integration** – Building upon our rudimentary alpha version to integrate with any Ethereum token based community (ERC-721, 1155, and 20)\n- **Custom Push Notifications** – Creating a customizable push notification system where Nouners (and other Nounish DAO members) will be able to choose frequency (live, daily, weekly) and type of notifications from a selection of onchain events (new proposal submitted, funded, voting open, capital deployed, prop house voting open, etc.).\n- **Admin Panel** – Creating an admin panel for teams to manage & send custom push notifications & update the text & links on the back of the passes.\n- **Pass Designs** – Automating the design process of wallet passes based on any NFT visual assets. For Nouns and lil Nouns we’ll design custom passes which we’ll share with the community for approval. For other communities, we’ll automatically assign a color scheme based on the NFT imagery (unique for each NFT).\n\n********************************Potential future use cases********************************\n\n- Token gating IRL with a QR scanner: Wallet Service would allow for a very simple 1 NFT = 1 Event Ticket gating system.\n- Integrating new sources of notifications for Nouns/Nounish DAOs such as Prop House events, votes from key delegates (Nouncil voted “For” Proposal 367), 3rd party sources to select from (ex. Discord), etc.\n- Ability to customize pass fields to include points/token balance(s), contributor status, awards, and to allow users to add their name to the card or select their own colors.",

This is our rule.\n\nAccording to the “squad vote” result for proposal 255, which is 1 for, 17 against and 6 abstain, we choose to vote against.The viewpoints of our different members are as follows (source not listed):\n\nOpposing views on the proposal:\n1. The community wallet product originated from a private social club similar to FWB, which is more suitable for closed community scenarios and not applicable to open Nouns. However, it may be adopted by subDAOs of Nouns.\n2. Why should Nouns pay 120 ETH for an integrated service? The proposal for NounsWallet is different from Prop House and House Of Nouns' building products from scratch for Nouns. The product was not adopted in FWB, and now they are applying for funding in Nouns to do integration, which is extremely unreasonable. Nouns provides both users and funds to integrate a product service.\n3. There is insufficient confidence in timely delivery of the product. This is PoolSuite team's first proposal at Noun. In the past, the team has delayed delivery of products such as https://grandleisure.org/.\n\nSupporting views on the proposal:\n1. The proposer of Proposal 255, PoolSuite, is a talented team with excellent aesthetics in their FM magazine products etc., even if there have been delays in delivery we are willing to wait for them to produce results.",

      "description": "# Rage Quit (2)\n\nResubmission since the previous prop would revert due to an incorrect txn bundle (a future prop could add Tenderly txn simulation that would simulate the prop execution). \n\n**Rage Quit Contract**: 0x95852813766e4A3112891FE6a47100023D61e5a4\n\n### Summary\n\n- RQ has been a topic discussed many times but hasn't been actually implemented. With a growing number of disgruntled members of this DAO, rage quit should have been an option a long time ago. Thank you to all members who have delegated their votes to me.\n\n- The primary argument that prevented RQ was that RQ somehow makes Nouns a security and holds the DAO liable for breaking SEC laws. This is quite flawed as the DAO already operates in grey waters in relation to SEC regulations.\n\n- The DAO has already acted as seed investors in proposals and mimics an investment syndicate.\nNouns are essentially class A shares for an entity with a large treasury.\nA large portion of the treasury is in stETH which is an active area of discussion of whether it is a security or not.\n\nIf someone wanted to argue that NounsDAO breaks securities laws, they would have already done so, adding rage quit does not suddenly make Nouns a security.\n\n### Rage Quit Details\nThis implementation is the simplest form of RQ (the contract is only ~100 lines minus comments), we didn’t want to add any smart contract complications. The flow goes as follows:\n\n1. The treasury will fund the RQ contract in rounds. Round 1 will consist of 25% of the treasury (25% of the ETH and 25% of the stETH). If Round 1 is fully claimed (25% of Nouns have rage quit), another RQ proposal to fund Round 2 will be submitted to fund another 25% (and so on and so on). The reasoning for rounds is that we don’t want to handicap the DAO by taking custody of all funds while RQ is in process.\n\n2. Round 1 will be active for 2 weeks, during that time, holders that wish to ragequit will transfer their Nouns to the RQ contract and receive their book value of the treasury. The reason we lock Nouns into the contract versus burn Nouns is because only the DAO has the permissions to burn Nouns, thus, the DAO can retrieve all Nouns from the contract at any point.\n\n3. In the case there are funds left in the RQ contract after the deadline (no more people want to rage quit), the DAO can take back all remaining funds.\n\n4. Only Nouns up to Noun #634 (the last noun before this proposal) will be eligible for RQ. This is to prevent new bidders from attempting to arbitrage new Nouns that get auctioned until the prop passes/fails. We are aware that there are Nouns on secondary (currently 12) that may be arbed against the treasury but the way we look at it, these Nouns will be used to get RFV from the treasury regardless. The Nouns selling on secondary below RFV will either be delisted and claimed for RFV or someone will buy the Noun and potentially claim for RFV. Thus, the treasury doesn’t gain more rage quitters from the Nouns on secondary (at the very best people that buy don't rage quit).\n\n**The current book value for each Nouns is calculated as follows**:\n\nETH book value for 1 Noun is **19 ETH**. This is the treasuries ETH balance **rounded down** with a 5% rage quit fee, the total is also rounded down - floor(13144 eth / 634 * 0.95).\n\nStETH book value for 1 Noun is **22 ETH**. This is the treasuries StETH balance **rounded down** with a 5% rage quit fee, the total is also rounded down - floor(14764 eth / 634 * 0.95).\n\nReview of the contract:\nMost of the variables are immutable constants as to prevent any malicious prop that may siphon more funds out of the treasury.

This increases the claim deadline and should be called in the same prop that funds the RQ contract. This effectively sets new ‘rounds’ if previous rounds have been fully claimed.\n\n`function withdrawFunds() external`: This function can only be called via prop by the DAO. This allows the DAO to claim any left over funds from the RQ contract (in the case that there are no more rage quitters and there are funds left in the contract).\n\n`function withdrawNouns(uint256[] memory nounIDs) external`: This function can only be called via prop by the DAO. This allows the DAO to claim all Nouns that are locked in the contract.\n\n`function rageQuitSingleNoun(uint256 nounID) external`: This function locks a single Noun into the contract and returns the Nouns book value to the sender.\n\n`function rageQuitNouns(uint256[] memory nounIDs) external`: This function locks multiple Nouns and returns book value to sender in a single txn.\n\nThe flow will be done via etherscan. It's a similar flow to Opensea where you first `setApprovalForAll()` for the RQ contract and then call `rageQuitSingleNoun()` with your Noun ID. If there is a desire for a frontend, we can whip something up quickly.\n\nFunding\nWe will fund the RQ contract with 3268 ETH and 3674 StETH which will allow up to 172 Nouns to rage quit (~25%).\n\n25% of ETH calculation: floor(13144 * 0.25 / 19) * 19\n25% of StETH calculation: floor(14767 * 0.25 / 22) * 22\n\nTransactions\nSending 3268 ETH and 3674 StETH to RQ contract + setting the deadline to rage quit for round 1 to be April 4 (2 weeks after this proposal passes).",

          "reason": "Imagine a world where voting does not exist. In this world, we would have no need for rules or principles. But in our world, voting is a reality. So we have a simple rule: we only vote against. We use a “Squad Vote” for each proposal. If more people vote against than vote for or abstain, we vote against on-chain. Otherwise, we abstain. This is our rule.\n\nAccording to the “squad vote” result for proposal 241, which is 5 for, 18 against and 0 abstain, we choose to vote against.\n\nThe proposal's opinion is clear, and we do not recommend taking Rage Quit immediately. It's not just an issue with the content of the proposal itself, but also the caution regarding the level of the proposal.\n\nOur opposing viewpoints:\n\n1. Refuse to change the constitutional-level rules of the DAO without evidence that Rage Quit is effective (MolochDAO rarely uses Rage Quit) or sufficient community debate. Proposals of this level require lengthy debate, repeated proposals and opposition, and then approval. Changing the underlying rules lightly is irresponsible to the consensus. It is normal for a system to have human flaws at every level. However, a casual attitude towards underlying rules could destroy the Nouns system, a stable system is better than no system.\n2. NounsDAO already has a secondary market exit method. Rage Quit is a term that appears powerful on the surface, but in essence, it is a bad price market-making way. It does not have the game-theoretical effect it promises.\n3. The importance behind Rage Quit is not angry, but forking. The execution of this proposal did not enhance the system or generate more viable branches, but resulted in a loss of consensus, which is negative on the margin. Instead, leaving feedback for continuous improvement of the system can turn it into a way to enhance the system. The efficiency of Nouns proposal supervision has also been improving and will continue to progress.\n4. The proposal implies that everyone is angry, which is a language game. The fact is that most users have a mixed feeling of disappointment and hope. Any one-sided release of hope or anger will damage a system.\n5. Earlier proposal 192 had a more comprehensive rage quit design called theDAO Split mechanism/design. The proposer, Verbs team, pointed out that although it is still under discussion with legal counsel, they believe it is the best solution for Nouns. They are now soliciting community opinions and think it is very urgent to implement it as soon as possible.\n\nThe supporting viewpoints for this proposal are very simple:\n1. Promote the equal vision of Nouns: Each Nouns subdao represents Nouns, and NounsDAO is just one branch. This is a more attractive future, a dynamic and ongoing future.",

          "reason": "Alana here, from Variant. We’ve decided to vote against Nouns Prop 248. \n\nA key risk is that rage quit risks a stifling of treasury funds. Each treasury activation / funding grant would at least temporarily lower the book value of Nouns, so holders are faced with a trade-off every time they vote on a proposal: fund the prop vs. preserve the book value of their Noun. In theory, this creates a forcing function for better evaluating the merits of each prop – only props which are believed to drive future value to the DAO in excess of the current book value of each Noun would pass. In practice, that’s hard to quantify proactively. The consequence could be fewer funding approvals, especially for more provocative experiments that may not have as explicit financial returns. \n\nWe recognize that, even if this proposal is defeated, it’s likely not the last time we’ll see a rage quit proposal submitted to the Nouns DAO. In light of this, it’s worth taking a moment to revisit some of what makes Nouns special:\n\n\nThe ability to activate funds for bold, unique experiments in brand and community building\nHighly engaged community members\nA consistent source of funding (the daily auction)\n\nAny implementation of rage quit should seek to preserve those core primitives. 4156 has already proposed one alternative mechanism, whereby any Nouner who votes but lands in the minority on a proposal can rage quit as a sign of their dissent. This version would help encourage continued community engagement (by making voting a prerequisite to rage quitting), while preserving the ability of the community to access funding for projects. There may be other versions that preserve and protect the values of Nouns as well. We’re committed to evaluating each proposal on its individual merits. But today the version in question is what’s proposed in Prop 248, and we’re voting no. ",

Finish development, testing and deploy a generalized NFT random distributor which enables any proposer to propose distribution of current or future NFTs in our Treasury. The distributor makes use of new tech I call “functional props”; meaning the prop itself determines how many NFTs to distribute at execution time as a function of the prop’s vote counts. `Now includes a Pull Request into the nouns.wtf front-end to allow for a better UX when proposing NFT distributions.`\n3. Develop, test, audit and deploy a contract that enables proposers to ask for functional funding. Functional funding allows proposers to suggest a funding range within which they are willing to execute a prop. The actual funding amount received is determined by the prop’s vote counts. `Now includes a Pull Request into the nouns.wtf front-end to allow for better UX when proposing range or milestone funding.`\n\n# Why Functional Props?\n\n*Cool tech, cool experiment. But how is it useful?*\n\n`Historically, all DAO proposals have had binary outcomes (pass or fail). The time has come to invent tooling for DAOs to allow for non-binary outcomes on votes, and for Nouns to lead the way on this.`\n\n`Take Prop 239 (comic book purchase) as an example. The DAO could be in agreement that it makes sense to purchase comic books, but not necessarily 5,000 of them. If the prop’s voting outcome were non-binary, the DAO would have had a way to simultaneously decide if it makes sense, and also how many comic books to print. Maybe the prop wouldn’t have had to be canceled.`\n\nFor both NFT distribution and funding it’s a more efficient way of achieving “middle ground”; a form of consensus.\n\nThink about it as a way of taking an on-chain average of all opinions.\n\nThe current alternative is an attention-deprived off-chain back and forth between proponent and community to arrive at a proposal price point or distribution number.\n\n# `Past props where functional props would have been useful`\n\n`Prop 236: Wizard’s Hat — determine the mint price of our NFT together at vote time, from a range.`\n\n`Prop 223: House of Nouns — Implement milestones instead of all or nothing.  Milestones are mapped to voting tiers. The more popular the prop is at vote time, more funding is sent and more features get implemented.`\n\n`Prop 217: Stake an additional 5,000 ETH in LIDO — instead stake between 1,000-5,000 depending on the level of support for the prop.`\n\n`Prop 206: Nouns on the Ground 2023 — Do tiered funding (5, 10, or 15 IRL events) instead of all or nothing.`\n\n`Prop 202: nouns.eth set reverse record — in addition to executing, do we also send 1 ETH to Jacob? Depending on the popularity of the prop, we send between 0-1ETH.`\n\n`Prop 184: Nouns funding ZachXBT — fund within range 50-100 ETH, instead of all or nothing.`\n\n`Prop 167: Nouns Builder — seed the Builder treasury within a range (e.g. 500-1,000 ETH).`\n\n`Prop 125: 8/8 anniversary art — only change existing traits if the vote is unanimous.*`\n\n# `Answers to common doubts on functional funding`\n\n### `What if a proposer that is willing to do work for 30 ETH proposes a range of 30-50 ETH to squeeze out more from the DAO?`\n\n`A proposer is disincentivized to do so, as it increases the likelihood of the prop being defeated. It could also be argued conversely, that if functional funding wasn’t possible, the proposer could have proposed an all-or-nothing 50 ETH instead of a range where the DAO could save money if the prop passes, but barely. We can’t be certain if functional funding will make overall payouts larger or smaller, but we can be sure that funds will be allocated more efficiently as more granularity allows for concentrating capital where it needs to be.`\n\n### `If I support a proposal getting the lower part of the range, but not the upper part, how am I supposed to decide how to vote before the very last second?`\n\n`Granted that this is a tricky aspect of functional funding. I give a two-part answer:`\n\n`1. The question doesn’t apply to all props where functional funding could be useful. For example, take the hypothetical use for Prop 217 (staking in LIDO). If you are OK with staking 5,000 ETH, you are OK with staking 1,000. In this case, you it doesn’t really matter to you if you vote early or later. If you aren’t comfortable with staking up to 5,000 ETH, you vote against. You would have voted against Prop 217 in its non-functional funding incarnation anyway.`\n`2. Granted that those who vote later have more information than those who vote earlier. However, those that vote earlier likely are OK with the entire range. Those that vote later will have more influence over the outcome. This is a net positive: a. those who are OK with the entire range are happy. b. those who want to control the range, can do so by voting later.`\n\n### `Even though the tech is innovative, I don’t see it being widely adopted`\n\n`Refer to the section above where I highlight some use cases that make Nouns a more agile decision-making DAO.`\n\n### `The main mechanics of the DAO should stick to the KISS principle`\n\n`The concern is that it should be made as simple as possible for Nouners to vote. I agree that simpler is better. Most props will not make use of functional funding and will stick to KISS. However, for those that it makes sense to make outcomes functional, if it’s more efficient for the DAO, it’s worth the marginal complexity.`\n\n# Phase 1: Generalized NFT Distributor\n\nBefore functional funding comes functional NFT distribution.\n\nI am the dev and proposer behind [Prop 199](https://nouns.wtf/vote/199) which passed 226 : 9. Prop 199 was a successful experiment to distribute 50 Nouns Vision Glasses from our Treasury to Nouners at random.\n\nI have developed (inspect code [here](https://github.com/0xDigitalOil/nouns-props/tree/master/GeneralizedNFTDistributor)) a generalized version of the Nouns Vision Glasses distributor that allows for any proposer to propose random distribution of any ERC-721 in our Treasury to Nouners. This included development of a generalized version of the BatchTransfer contract [9999.⌐◨-◨](https://twitter.com/lastpunk9999) deployed for [Prop 185](https://nouns.wtf/vote/185).\n\nAs this deployment is not a one-off and meant to be a primitive the DAO can leverage at any time, plus the code is more complex, it requires more extensive testing. In addition, it requires a more complex custom front-end for the distribution claims.\n\n## `Why do we need a generalized NFT distributor?`\n\n`The Nouns DAO treasury continues to hoard NFTs as subDAOs such as Lil Nouns and Nouns Builder are “paying backwards” in the form of governance tokens.`\n\n`It is likely that as the Nouns meme proliferates, more and more subDAOs will continue to do the same.`\n\n`Historically, we haven’t used these NFTs to govern these subDAOs and to this date haven’t reached consensus as to whether it’s something we are interested in doing as a DAO.`\n\n`There is no point in having NFTs in our treasury that we don’t plan on using. If we are to go down the alternate path, who better than Nouners to receive them and participate in subDAO governance in an individual, more decentralized manner.`\n\n## Functional Distribution\n\nThe generalized NFT distributor has a new distribution mechanism baked in that allows the proposer to set the maximum number of NFTs to distribute. Then, if the prop passes, at execution time, the distribution contract calculates the number of NFTs to randomly distribute as a function of the vote (for, against, abstain) counts.\n\nThe proposer also selects the distribution amount calculation mechanism. This code extract shows the possible distribution rules the proposer can select from:\n\n![Proposer can select among the following distribution rules: Total turnout per Noun, Total Turnout minus abstain per Noun, For Votes, For Votes per Noun, For minus Against Votes, For minus Against Votes per Noun.](https://i.ibb.co/Gthy2Nj/Untitled.png)\n\nProposer can select among the following distribution rules: Total turnout per Noun, Total Turnout minus abstain per Noun, For Votes, For Votes per Noun, For minus Against Votes, For minus Against Votes per Noun.\n\nFor example, the proposer might want to propose a distribution of some LilNouns in the treasury. The proposer is unsure of how many LilNouns the DAO is willing to distribute so he/she selects VotesFor as the distribution mechanism. Thus, the higher “For Vote” turnout (the more popular the prop was), the more LilNouns will be distributed. \n\n## Prop Execution\n\nHere’s how proposing and execution works:\n\n![Untitled](https://i.ibb.co/nn33yHB/Untitled-1.png)\n\n# Phase 2: Functional Funding\n\nI call “functional props” proposals that are self-referential at prop execution time. Initially I’m interested in exploring props that use vote counts (i.e., how many for/against/abstain) as inputs and take actions as a function of those inputs. We could imagine going beyond that to enable props that pull from a larger voter input-space such as vote reasons*.\n\nFunctional funding is a subset of functional props that enables an efficient way for the DAO to price proposals. The mechanism works as follows:\n\n1. Proposer writes a prop where he/she proposes to do some work for Nouns DAO.\n2. The proposer sets the prop transaction to call the FunctionalFunding contract and selects a funding range (e.g. 30-50 ETH) and distribution rule. This signals to the DAO that he/she is willing to do the work for a minimum of 30 ETH, but if the DAO as a whole signals that it values the work being done greatly (via strong FOR support), the proposer will get funded more than 30 ETH, up to 50 ETH.\n3. If the prop passes, when it executes it references itself, reading its vote counts to determine the funding amount according to the distribution rule.\n4. FunctionalFunding contract sends the calculated amount of ETH.\n\n![Untitled](https://i.ibb.co/bgPmDV1/Untitled-2.png)\n\n## What does this solve?\n\nFor Proposers:\n\n- Allows the proposer to do an all-in-one price discovery by “polling” all voters on-chain\n- Lower probability of good proposals being rejected due to mere price → avoids going back, adjusting price and resubmitting\n\nFor Voters:\n\n- Decision is less stressful as it’s less binary. You can be OK with the prop content and range and “delegate” decision of the price point to the rest of the voters\n\nFor Nouns DAO:\n\n- All-in-one prop voting and efficient price discovery\n- Proposals are more likely to be funded closer to “fair price” than the current binary funding mechanism\n- `For the first time, allows the DAO to vote on proposals that need to pass unanimously to execute`\n\n# Deliverables\n\n1. Trustless, immutable primitive contract-set that allow Nouners to propose random distribution of NFTs, where the final number of NFTs distributed is a function of proposal popularity.\n2. Front-end for claiming NFTs of said distribution rounds. Allows for multiple distribution rounds per NFT collection.\n3. Trustless, immutable primitive contract that allow Nouners to create proposals that are funded within a range as a function of proposal popularity.\n4. `UI on [nouns.wtf](http://nouns.wtf) similar to the USDC converter, that allows proposers to select and input parameters for functional NFT distributions or funding.`\n\n# `Positive feedback on Prop 238`\n\n**`The innovative approach to Human Organization presented here is a promising addition to the Nouns toolkit, which continues to lead the way with innovative public goods. I support the continued exploration of fresh governance approaches, such as the \"Function Props\" concept, which can leverage the benefits of large group decision-making.`**\n\n**`I'm in favor of experimenting to find better mechanisms we can use to reach non-binary outcomes for proposals and for that reason I'm voting in favor. Even if this isn't used much or is used and we discover what the shortcoming is, that would be a plus in my book.`**\n\n**`I think that it is important for the DAO to continue to explore new ways to use governance to resolve conflict, and I see \"Function Props\" as a promising direction here. They could offer a way to take advantage of the concave decision making advantage of large groups: where any point along the spectrum from 0 to 1 is higher value than either a 0 or 1 outcome.`**\n\n**`innovative price discovery`**\n\n**`Great way to put the NFTs in the treasury to work!`**\n\n**`Sounds like this can be implemented, so I'm in full support. More than reasonable cost.`**\n\n**`Digitaloil is demonstrably dedicated, creative and aligned with Nouns long term and wants to try and build a useful Nounish primitive.  Let's see how he impresses.`**\n\n**`i think the cost is fair, and it could also lead to new ideas to improve or offer alternatives to the current proposal constraints.`**\n\n**`Nounish dev building nounish things - hopefully having funding methods like this save the dao money in the long term`**\n\n**`nounishly positive`**\n\n**`The range funding is the killer app here imo. Gives proposers with that flexibility the option to potentially get more vote support than a fixed rate.`**\n\n# Ask\n\n`38` ETH sent to me, [DigitalOil](https://twitter.com/0xDigitalOil). \n\nIf only I could propose a functional funding range 🤷‍♂️.\n\n### Funding breakdown\n\n1. 15 ETH — finish testing of NFT Distributor contracts. Develop generalized claim front-end.\n2. 20 ETH — Develop functional funding contract, including contract audit.\n3. `3 ETH — Pull requests into [nouns.wtf](http://nouns.wtf) front-end for a better UX and reduce friction when proposers choose to submit a functional prop instead of a binary prop.`\n\n*Note that using vote reasons as inputs to functional props would require a change to the governance contract as vote reasons are currently not introspectable at execution time.",

This is our rule.\n\nAccording to the “squad vote” result for proposal 241, which is 5 for, 24 against and 15 abstain, we choose to vote against. \n\nWe abstained in the last proposal, because we appreciated DigitalOil’s exploration of dynamic range for community fundraising tools. The reason for the change in the outcome of the two rounds of proposals is that the new proposal became more and more difficult to understand, especially the second part.\n\nWe support the exploration of dynamic funding. The content of the second part belongs to a direction that is correct, but proposes an overly complicated experimental scheme. The new proposal itself did not improve, and requires a philosophical dialectical understanding to enter the context of the proposal, which is a good idea, but not a product that people need.\n\nAlthough DigitalOil absorbed everyone’s opinions and made improvements. The financial and team parts of the proposal still did not improve, making the evaluation more difficult. We suggest implementing the first part of the product and applying for a “Small Grant”.\n\nAlthough we vote against, we recognize DigitalOil’s product philosophy, and the mechanization of dynamic financial governance is a very important direction. Nouns’ funding support means are limited (on-chain proposal, Small Round, Prop House), and it is difficult to fund governance thinkers and developers like DigitalOil.\n\nWhen the product is just an early personal idea, and has not reached the stage of being needed by the community, it should not use On-chain Proposal. Maybe we can open a round of “dynamic funding” Prop House to explore this path?",

      "description": "# Nounish Dataverse, open source data\n\n**TLDR**: Aggregating and organizing data from  applications, and making it open source and composable. The aggregated data will be published in a decentralized database and accessible through a GraphQL API.\n\n**Goal**: Our goal is to make it easier for people to use and control their data in the Nouniverse. We'll use [Ceramic](https://ceramic.network/) and decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to achieve this, allowing data to flow more easily between different applications in the network. This will help solve issues with scattered/fragmented data and make it more easily available to everyone. We'll also establish a universal identity system to make it easier for different applications to share the same user account. Ultimately, we're working to create a reliable and efficient decentralized network that provides a better experience for users.\n\n![Qm-Toek-X1-Fsy-Dp-PXPn3mi-KPCns-VHy-Z6-H1-Pmka-A5qz4p-TVDj.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/T1Sn4xgM/Qm-Toek-X1-Fsy-Dp-PXPn3mi-KPCns-VHy-Z6-H1-Pmka-A5qz4p-TVDj.jpg)\n-   **What is the platform's function?** The platform can store and manage large amounts of data for decentralized protocols, allowing developers to easily create new applications that build upon existing data and contribute to the data graph.\n    \n- **What are the key benefits of the platform?** The platform enables innovative applications and user experiences, reduces data and application fragmentation, increases data sovereignty, facilitates integration and development, and improves interoperability and composability among participating applications.\n    \n-   **What problems are being addressed?** Universal identity, data and application fragmentation, data availability, and data composability.\n\n-   **Why can’t Ethereum be used to store the data?** “Ethereum itself can be used as a decentralized storage system, and it is when it comes to code storage in all the smart contracts. However, when it comes to large amounts of data, that isn't what Ethereum was designed for. The chain is steadily growing, but at the time of writing, the Ethereum chain is around 500GB - 1TB (depending on the client), and every node on the network needs to be able to store all of the data. If the chain were to expand to large amounts of data (say 5TBs) it wouldn't be feasible for all nodes to continue to run. Also, the cost of deploying this much data to Mainnet would be prohibitively expensive due to gas fees.” - [Ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/bg/developers/docs/storage/)\n\n\n-   **Why is this platform preferable to IPFS, or similar solutions currently available in the market?**  We'll be using [ComposeDB](https://composedb.js.org/), which leverages Ceramic, a mutable layer for IPFS with anchoring on Ethereum for finality. By using Ceramic, the Nounish platform is able to provide faster data retrieval and processing, as well as advanced data management tools such as decentralized identifiers (DIDs) that enable greater control and ownership over data. \n\n- **Who are the team members?** **Baba**: 1 of 5 Nouns DAO Governance Prop House Mandate Winners, Datapod Co-Lead for Lil Nouns, Lil Nouns grants committee multi-sig signer. **Al409**: 2x Lil Noun DAO resident, and Agora Nouner Delegate Winner.  **Ripe, Volky**: Prop House Winners and BuilderDAO contributors. **Brunes, Champion Score**: Ex-Stripe, Ex-Google, and Nouns Governance Prop House Mandate Winners.\n\n## Problem Statement\nAs the DAO grows, people must navigate an environment that is increasingly fragmented. The data produced by many small and large applications are scattered, siloed and inconsistent in format and structure, making it difficult for users to access and utilize. This fragmentation lowers the accessibility, usability, and value of the data, and limits the potential insights and innovations that can be gained from it.\n\n  \n\nIn addition, only a small subset of all data in the Nouniverse is stored on-chain, which can create challenges for developers and users who need to access and use this data. In a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), data is a critical asset that drives decision-making, governance, and value creation. Therefore, it is important for a DAO to have a decentralized data network like Ceramic that provides users with greater control and ownership of their data, and enables interoperability and composability of data across different applications, including off-chain data.\n\n  \n**Vision**: In a future wherein permissionless data collaboration achieves critical mass within the DAO, users would have unprecedented control and ownership over their data, with the ability to easily share and reuse it across different participating applications. The decentralized nature of Ceramic would ensure that data is stored securely and efficiently, without the risk of censorship or centralization. The interoperability and composability enabled by Ceramic would lead to a proliferation of innovative and user-centric applications, breaking down the barriers that currently exist between different platforms and ecosystems. The benefits of this future would extend beyond just the technical members of the DAO, as all users would be able to take advantage of the seamless and intuitive interfaces enabled by the data network. The adoption of Ceramic would be a major step towards a more open and equitable internet, where data is treated as a commons to be shared and nurtured, rather than a commodity to be monetized and controlled.\n\n![Qm-Vda-PMMMe-Sj1-J6-RSeuizx-N1u-Bq-LAPc-N1f-G9phu-Uuv-Bk-Wb.png](https://i.postimg.cc/KzWKZNzt/Qm-Vda-PMMMe-Sj1-J6-RSeuizx-N1u-Bq-LAPc-N1f-G9phu-Uuv-Bk-Wb.png)\n\n## Objectives\n-   To create a decentralized data network and database that can make it easier for people to access, understand and use data in the Nouniverse.\n-   To give people more control and ownership over their data through the use of decentralized identifiers (DIDs).\n-   To make it possible for different applications to share and use data, creating new possibilities for how data can be used.\n-   To provide developers with access to a permissionless data layer, which includes information on governance, funding, and user activity for the DAO.\n-   To make it easy for developers to integrate with and build on top of the data that the DAO has collected.\n-   To enable developers to tap into the network effects of the DAO by allowing their applications to connect and interact with each other.\n-   To enable a more open and equitable internet where data is treated as a shared resource rather than a commodity that can be controlled and monetized.\n\n## Deliverables - 3 Month Timeline\nTo achieve these objectives, we will deliver the following components: infrastructure, applications, and services.\n\n**Infrastructure**: The infrastructure component involves deploying a Ceramic network node that runs an instance of ComposeDB, a decentralized, composable graph database. This node will serve the applications, which can read and write data permissionlessly (subject to data ownership constraints). The raw data backing this database is stored in IPFS. In order to bootstrap application use cases, relevant on-chain and off-chain data will be imported, processed and stored into ComposeDB. The data will be attributed with relationships for composability and made available via a GraphQL API.\n\n**Applications**: Three applications will be deployed on the Ceramic network by the core team upon completion.\n\n-   **NounsID** - The identity interface for the Nouniverse. A user profile for participants of the Nouns ecosystem, composed of user-owned properties and relationships to data from sources such as on-chain proposals and votes, PropHouse, Snapshot and Discourse. The user-owned profile allows the user to control their represented identity, linking it to social media accounts, setting up their preferences and carrying them across application built atop the decentralized data layer.\n    \n-   **Builder Profile** - Builder profiles (nounish cv) are meant to give a full picture of a nounish builder's contributions to the Nouniverse, leveraging data aggregated from NounID, stored on the decentralized data layer.\n    \n-   **Noundry** - Will integrate with the Ceramic network, leveraging its decentralized datastore, and our universal identity (NounsID). Noundry Ceramic Integration may include but are not limited by the following features:\n    \n    -  Upload your traits once, use it all across the ecosystem! - Create your artist profile and keep your own provenance records - Include metadata with your artwork. Give it name & context.\n    - Remix & collab on everything, powered by CC0 Some ideas of integrations to harness this data: \n    - Noundry contests, to sign up your traits and try to make them into official Nouns traits. \n    - Builder DAO, to boot a new DAO with Nounish artwork using a collection of existing traits. \n    - Noun DAO UIs, to show tooltips over the Nouns with more info about the traits and their artists\n    - Other features to explore: cross-dao artwork compatibility by mapping out trait categories, templates, sizes & color palettes - Scraping of existing artwork and contacting artists to seed their profiles - Offering the artwork in multiple formats (svg, png) for better compatibility with different applications\n\n\n**Services**: \n- Throughout development, the team will provide weekly Q&A during office hours, hosted by The Noun Square. \n- The team will provide a JavaScript library that makes it easy for front-end applications to query and deploy their own data. \n- Finally, we will collaborate with AI Pod, providing the processed and formatted data relevant for training their models.\n\n## Deliverables:\n**Infrastructure Component:**\n-   **Nounish decentralized database**: We'll run a Ceramic and ComposeDB node that serves the data through a GraphQL API.\n- **Scrape/ingest real Nouns data sources**: Collect PropHouse, on-chain, Snapshot and Discourse data in near real-time, so that apps can query and compose them through our service.\n- **Client library for easy integration**: Provide a JavaScript library that client applications can use to easily query and publish data.\n- **Nouner preferences:** Deploy a Preferred proposal categories, optional social links, preferred Noun profile image and other .\n- **Support and/or integrate with partners and application developers**: Work with the community to brainstorm on new and existing models and incorporate feedback.\n    \n>**Note**: Part of this work has been started with 15k USD subsidized by the Ceramic builder grants.\n\n\n**Application Component:**\n-   **1st Party, Core Applications:** NounsID\n- **3rd Party, Nounish Partner Integrations:** Noundry Integration and Builder Profile\n\n**Services Component:**\n-   Provide ingested, and formatted data for AI Pod\n-   Provide developers with APIs and a library to leverage permissionless, composable databases as a service.\n-   Q&A with developers during regularly scheduled office hours on The Noun Square.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n-   **Uptime**: Functional network with availability on-par with centralized databases.\n-   **Integrations**: Successful integration with launch partner - Noundry.\n-  **Composability**: One or more demonstrable (ideally novel) composable and interoperable application use cases from pre-existing applications in the Nouns ecosystem.\n-   **Partnerships**: Number of pre-existing nounish applications that commit, and follow through with network integrations in the ecosystem that leverage the network.\n- **Data Sources**: Amount of data sources integrated, and CRUD operations executed on Ceramic.\n\n## Future Work\n\n-   Expand data sources to eventually include all relevant data generated in the Nouniverse and make it permissionless and composable, along with publishing relevant metadata from applications running on the network.\n-   Create developer tools, documentation, and examples to make development easier for developers.\n-   Partnerships: Coordinate with Voters.wtf, Federation, Lil Nouns mainsite, and Apache SuperSet(Nouns Metrics), for potential network integration.\n\n## Team Structure & Budget\n\n- **Infrastructure, NounsID development:** \n    - Brunes: 7.75 ETH/Month\n    - Champion Score: 7.5 ETH/Month\n- **Technical Program & Partnership Management:** \n    -  Al409: 3 ETH/Month\n    -  Baba: 7 ETH/Month \n- **Integration Partners:** \n    - Volky: 3 ETH/Month\n    - Ripe: 3 ETH/Month\n- **Builder Grants**: ETH allocation to be used for Prop House rounds, and/or direct developer/builder integrations with Ceramic in order to bootstrap the network effects of our Nounish dataverse. Builder funds that are not used will be returned to NounsDAO treasury. \n    - 7.5 ETH/Month\n\n\n\n\n\n**Amount/Time**: 39 ETH/Month\n**Duration**: 3 months\n**Total**: 117 ETH",

NounsDAO will benefit greatly from it. It will enhance the overall daotool development of the Nounish ecosystem. We support the team in exploring the path of data composability for Nounish. Infrastructure exploration is highly risky and uncertain. It is harder than imagined. But the team has a good track record to prove that they have a deep understanding and patience for it.\n\nOur opposition mainly comes from:\n1. Is it too early to do it now? \nNounish Dataverse may be like Web3 Social projects, unable to find Builders to develop products/tools that everyone needs, infrastructure but running applications that no one uses on top. \n\nThere is no information indicating that applications currently in demand (Prop House, Nouns Agora, House of Nouns, Nouns.Build, Dune Dashboard..) would consider using Ceramic as their data backend. It is much more difficult for applications to be demanded than to do underlying infrastructure. Holding a Prop House Round as mentioned in the proposal does not solve this problem.\n\n2. The proposal delivers too much content \nThe Nounish Dataverse proposal promises a decentralized database based on Ceramic, developer documentation, ID system integration application… A single proposal combines too many things to do. We recognize 30% of what’s in the proposal but 70% is over-committed.",

I think what would be most valuable and what this should focus on is getting all existing Noun data on ceramic and set up infrastructure to add new in real time. For example all traits and auction data. Make a system so it's easy for anyone to query trait stats. Give me all Nouns with gameboy head. Or give me todays auction and all traits.

      "description": "# Noun Tracks - Unlocking the sounds of Nouns\n\n\nAuthors: Arpeggi Labs, Nate Fox & Joshua Fisher.\n\n## **TL;DR**\nNoun Tracks are the fully on-chain 1:1 CC0 theme songs of a Noun created using Arpeggi Labs' on-chain DAW with samples and patterns performed and written by Nate Fox.\n\nTogether we will develop and launch Noun Tracks.  These NFT's are claimable for Nouners plus all the tools will be public and sounds will be compeletely CC0 for the community to enjoy.\n\n## **How?**\n### Part 1 - The Noun Track Stack\nNouns have a stack of visual characteristics that make them unique, with Noun Tracks now they have their own sounds too!\n\nNoun Tracks contain a 1:1 sonic representation of every layer of a Noun. \n\nEach visible layer of the Noun corresponds to a unique component of the song:\n\n\n**Layer 1 - Backgrounds (2)** - Key, either Major or Minor.\n\n```\nKey_Background {\n    boolean major;\n} \n```\n\n**Layer 2 - Bodies (30)** - Chord Progressions containing unique Bass & Harmony patterns and samples. These correspond to the \"body\" of the song.\n\n```\nChordProgression_Bodies {\n\tPattern bass;\n\tPattern harmony;\n\tSample bassSample;\n    Sample harmonySample;\n}\t\n```\n\n**Layer 3 - Accessories (137)** - Drum Loops containing unique snare, hat, percussion and kick patterns and samples. These provide a nice \"accessory\" to the other melodic components to the song.\n\n```\nDrumLoop_Accessory {\n    Pattern kick.\n    Pattern snare;\n    Pattern hat;\n    Pattern perc;\n    Sample kickSample;\n    Sample snareSample; \n    Sample hatSample;\n    Sample percSample;\n}\n```\n\n**Layer 4 - Heads (234)** - Lead Sample and Sound Effects. 234 Sample + Sound Effect combinations give each Noun. \nThese custom Lead Samples plus fun FX Sample moments give each Noun Track a distinctive personality. For example, Nouns with the shark head will have a shark chomp sound effect!\n\n```\nFX_Heads {\n    Sample lead;\t\n    Pattern fx;\n    Sample fxSample;\n} \n```\n\n**Layer 5 - Glasses (21 patterns)** - Lead Pattern, aka the musical notation of the Lead Sample produced by Nate.\n\n```\nLead_Glasses {\n\tPattern lead;\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Part 2 - Construction of a Noun Track\nOnce an auction is settled and a new Noun appears a new Noun Track is created and minted! \n\nUsing a custom \"Noun Track Creation Contract\" Arpeggi will pull the correspoding Samples and Patterns from the current Nouns features to create each days Noun Track. \n\n**Example Noun Track**\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJaT7N4OY.png)\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryOUougFt.png)](https://vimeo.com/647873210)\n\n\n\n```\nNoun_Track {\n\tKey_Background key;\n    ChordProgression_Bodies chords;\n    DrumLoop_Accessory drums;\n    FX_Heads fx;\n    Lead_Glasses lead;\n}\n```\n\n\n\n\n**Additional Noun Tracks Samples**\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJbJ4ENut.png)\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJyni_xFt.png)](https://vimeo.com/647873573)\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rydSUNEOF.png)\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Syc0odgKt.png)](https://vimeo.com/647873417)\n\n\n(*please note that this was created using a BETA Version of Arpeggi Nouns where Percussion field was used or FX.  The final version will have greater flexibility)\n\n### Part 3 - Minting & Distribution \n\nEvery Noun has a corresponding Noun Track that can be claimed by the Noun owner. A Nouner simply connects the wallet to NounTracks.wtf and they can claim their corresponding Noun Track.\n\nIn addtion to the NFT being minted the Noun Track will be simultaneously uploaded w/ it's Noun artwork to the traditional music DSP's and platforms. Using a platform such as Revelator's on-chain IP rights management system the royalties generated will be split between NounsDAO, the Nouner, and the creators at 33.3% each. \n\nDon't worry if you don't own a Noun. All tools are public and the music is CC0 so feel free to have some fun!\n\n## Who:\nApreggi Studios: Creators of the world's first on-chain music creation platform.\narpeggi.io\nhttps://medium.com/@arpeggilabs/arpeggi-studio-4bf465348d51\n\nNate Fox: Grammy awarded producer and songwriter who has worked with artists ranging from Chance The Rapper to Randy Newman. \nhttps://artists.spotify.com/songwriter/0uZyVM4hASpRCJgEUr6iIs\nhttps://music.apple.com/us/playlist/nate-fox-behind-the-boards/pl.84c458559b35469c9f7a88361ff959f5\n\nJoshua Fisher: Creative manager, SharkDAO member, Noun Prop Builder and Web3 enthusiast.\n\n## Costs:\nWe've broken down the cost into two Phases, with Phase 1 being paid a portion up front and portion upon launch. Phase 2 will be paid upon completion of Phase 1 in order to Launch. For avoidance of confusion Phase 2 would be paid before the backend of Phase 1.\n\n**Phase 1**\n40E - Music Creation: Nate will personally record and produce the sessions at his studio in Los Angeles creating all the custom sounds himself and with musicians in his network.  \n20 upfront, 20 wen mint\n\n30E - Arpeggi Music Platform: Arpeggi Labs will build a custom DAW that can be used by Nate, and the public after launch, to store the Samples and Patters used to generative daily Noun Tracks and put them on-chain. \n20 upfront, 10 wen mint\n\n10E - Project Management: Josh developed the idea, organized the parties and will continue to see the project through development, launch and beyond.\n5 upfront, 5 wen mint\n\n**Phase 2**\n10E - Smart Contract Development (Solidity): Arpeggi Labs will implement the Solidity smart contract that allows Noun holders to mint Noun Tracks.\n\n5E - Front End Development: Arpeggi Labs can build the site that allows for minting with connected wallet.\n\n5E - Other Costs: Projected gas fees for uploading Samples and Airdropping Nouners.\n\nAddresses:\nNate Fox:\n0xC36f41b8Da70aF447F6383a9E85287016e874bC7\n\nArpeggi: \n0x05B98Dd27D50B0B9dAF1b3Be7F299e7362B26B2E\n\nJoshua Fisher:\n0xBd7Dbab9AEb52D6c8d0E80fCeBdE3af4CC86204A\n\n\n## Timeline:\nWe're already hard at work as you can see and once this is approved Nate can continue creating and refining the Samples and Patterns and begin programming the tracks w/ Arpeggi.\n\nWe are targeting a launch in 8 weeks. \n\nPassing this proposal is a vote to fund the entire project (100 ETH), the remainder to be paid via an additional proposal when Phase 1 work is completed.",

      "description": "# Functional Props\n\n# TLDR\n\n1. Finish development, testing and deploy a generalized NFT random distributor which enables any proposer to propose distribution of current or future NFTs in our Treasury. The distributor makes use of new tech I call “functional props”; meaning the prop itself determines how many NFTs to distribute at execution time as a function of the prop’s vote counts.\n2. Develop, test, audit and deploy a contract that enables proposers to ask for functional funding. Functional funding allows proposers to suggest a funding range within which they are willing to execute a prop. The actual funding amount received is determined by the prop’s vote counts.\n\n# Why Functional Props?\n\n*Cool tech, cool experiment. But how is it useful?*\n\nFor both NFT distribution and funding it’s a more efficient way of achieving “middle ground”; a form of consensus.\n\nThink about it as a way of taking an on-chain average of all opinions.\n\nThe current alternative is an attention-deprived off-chain back and forth between proponent and community to arrive at a proposal price point or distribution number.\n\nThis [back and forth I had with Gami](https://twitter.com/0xDigitalOil/status/1622308820658651139) goes deeper. An extract:\n\n### What stops people from just setting the lower threshold to their ideal amount and upper threshold as buffer?\n\nIf you set the lower threshold to ideal amount you increase the risk of the prop not passing vs a vanilla prop ceteris paribus.\n\n### As for the thresholds, how would voters know that proposer set their levels in such a way?\n\nVoters will know the range of funding. When voting, you know that if there is intense support, the prop will hit the upper part of the range. If it barely passes, it will hit the lower part.\n\nYou base your vote on that.\n\nIf you feel comfortable with the funding range, you vote FOR. The more people feel comfortable with the range, the higher the funding.\n\nIt gives quadratic funding vibes.\n\n### When put like that it feels like it would alleviate some of the anxiety around voting too. Like sharing the load in a clever way. Nice.\n\nRight. Well put. Like smoothing out the noise in a signal with a moving average filter.\n\n# Phase 1: Generalized NFT Distributor\n\nBefore functional funding comes functional NFT distribution.\n\nI am the dev and proposer behind [Prop 199](https://nouns.wtf/vote/199) which passed 226 : 9. Prop 199 was a successful experiment to distribute 50 Nouns Vision Glasses from our Treasury to Nouners at random.\n\nI have developed (inspect code [here](https://github.com/0xDigitalOil/nouns-props/tree/master/GeneralizedNFTDistributor)) a generalized version of the Nouns Vision Glasses distributor that allows for any proposer to propose random distribution of any ERC-721 in our Treasury to Nouners. This included development of a generalized version of the BatchTransfer contract [9999.⌐◨-◨](https://twitter.com/lastpunk9999) deployed for [Prop 185](https://nouns.wtf/vote/185).\n\nAs this deployment is not a one-off and meant to be a primitive the DAO can leverage at any time, plus the code is more complex, it requires more extensive testing. In addition, it requires a more complex custom front-end for the distribution claims.\n\n## Functional Distribution\n\nThe generalized NFT distributor has a new distribution mechanism baked in that allows the proposer to set the maximum number of NFTs to distribute. Then, if the prop passes, at execution time, the distribution contract calculates the number of NFTs to randomly distribute as a function of the vote (for, against, abstain) counts.\n\nThe proposer also selects the distribution amount calculation mechanism. This code extract shows the possible distribution rules the proposer can select from:\n\n![Proposer can select among the following distribution rules: Total turnout per Noun, Total Turnout minus abstain per Noun, For Votes, For Votes per Noun, For minus Against Votes, For minus Against Votes per Noun.](https://i.ibb.co/Gthy2Nj/Untitled.png)\n\nProposer can select among the following distribution rules: Total turnout per Noun, Total Turnout minus abstain per Noun, For Votes, For Votes per Noun, For minus Against Votes, For minus Against Votes per Noun.\n\nFor example, the proposer might want to propose a distribution of some LilNouns in the treasury. The proposer is unsure of how many LilNouns the DAO is willing to distribute so he/she selects VotesFor as the distribution mechanism. Thus, the higher “For Vote” turnout (the more popular the prop was), the more LilNouns will be distributed. \n\n## Prop Execution\n\nHere’s how proposing and execution works:\n\n![Untitled](https://i.ibb.co/nn33yHB/Untitled-1.png)\n\n# Phase 2: Functional Funding\n\nI call “functional props” proposals that are self-referential at prop execution time. Initially I’m interested in exploring props that use vote counts (i.e., how many for/against/abstain) as inputs and take actions as a function of those inputs. We could imagine going beyond that to enable props that pull from a larger voter input-space such as vote reasons*.\n\nFunctional funding is a subset of functional props that enables an efficient way for the DAO to price proposals. The mechanism works as follows:\n\n1. Proposer writes a prop where he/she proposes to do some work for Nouns DAO.\n2. The proposer sets the prop transaction to call the FunctionalFunding contract and selects a funding range (e.g. 30-50 ETH) and distribution rule. This signals to the DAO that he/she is willing to do the work for a minimum of 30 ETH, but if the DAO as a whole signals that it values the work being done greatly (via strong FOR support), the proposer will get funded more than 30 ETH, up to 50 ETH.\n3. If the prop passes, when it executes it references itself, reading its vote counts to determine the funding amount according to the distribution rule.\n4. FunctionalFunding contract sends the calculated amount of ETH.\n\n![Untitled](https://i.ibb.co/bgPmDV1/Untitled-2.png)\n\n## What does this solve?\n\nFor Proposers:\n\n- Allows the proposer to do an all-in-one price discovery by “polling” all voters on-chain\n- Lower probability of good proposals being rejected due to mere price → avoids going back, adjusting price and resubmitting\n\nFor Voters:\n\n- Decision is less stressful as it’s less binary. You can be OK with the prop content and range and “delegate” price decision to the rest of the voters\n\nFor Nouns DAO:\n\n- All-in-one prop voting and efficient price discovery\n- Proposals are more likely to be funded closer to “fair price” than the current binary funding mechanism\n\n# Deliverables\n\n1. Trustless, immutable primitive contract-set that allow Nouners to propose random distribution of NFTs, where the final number of NFTs distributed is a function of proposal popularity.\n2. Front-end for claiming NFTs of said distribution rounds. Allows for multiple distribution rounds per NFT collection.\n3. Trustless, immutable primitive contract that allow Nouners to create proposals that are funded within a range as a function of proposal popularity.\n\n# Ask\n\n35 ETH sent to me, [DigitalOil](https://twitter.com/0xDigitalOil). \n\nIf only I could propose a functional funding range 🤷‍♂️.\n\n### Funding breakdown\n\n1. 15 ETH — finish testing of NFT Distributor contracts. Develop generalized claim front-end.\n2. 20 ETH — Develop functional funding contract, including contract audit.\n\n*Note that using vote reasons as inputs to functional props would require a change to the governance contract as vote reasons are currently not introspectable at execution time.",

A deep dive into a new world, full of rites, music, magic, secrets, fascinating images and testimonies of real characters who try to survive and maintain their traditions, in the midst of a civil war and the reality of goods smuggling.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kcvr6oP.jpg)\n\n**TLDR - Graduated in cinema from Université Lumière Lyon II in France, Daniel Leite is Author / Director / Photographer / Producer of the documentary “Kabadio - Here time is not in a hurry, it goes barefoot”. An independent production that played in more than 30 film festivals around the world, was part of important streaming catalogs such as Amazon Prime Video and received the Best Cinematography award at the 7th Festival Heritales - Lisbon, being watched by more than 300k people worldwide**.\n\n**[IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3365250/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1)**\n\n**Website Daniel - [www.danielleite.com.br](https://www.danielleite.com.br)**\n\n**Daniel's Producer Website - [www.domangfilmes.com.br](https://www.domangfilmes.com.br)**\n.\n\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/MREVFSG.jpg) ](https://vimeo.com/166749375)\n\n\n.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/F1p1Xub.jpg)\n\n.\n\n\n\n# **The project**\n\n![TOC](https://i.imgur.com/KuxOIe6.jpg)\n\n\nEngaged in Brazil national black cinema and after visiting the African continent many times, it was in 2006 that Daniel Leite started recording the feature film \"Kabadio, where time goes slowly, walks barefoot\". \n\nNow, 17 years later, Daniel intends to return to the African continent to meet characters who marked his lens. About 40 photos taken in 2006 were selected. Each photo has a story. They are portraits of the most varied possible, which will act as guides that will dictate the progress of our itinerary in the village.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rjrMvLM.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2MG7rXs.jpg)\n\n*What would it be like to meet the young Fatou N'Dei, now 20 years old?*\n\n*What stories does she carry with her?*\n\n*What was the village like for her at that time when you played in the rain?*\n\n*What was your father's fate, Badou?*\n\n*Did Fatou N'Dei follow the statistics and become a mother in her youth?*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/js6EJen.jpg)\n\n\nThe aim of the project is to make an observational documentary, sometimes poetic, sometimes in the photo essay and at other times with backstage coverage, with a making-of behavior camera. A cross between these subgenres will bring harmonic diversity, as the raw material will always be the same: the past of the people and the village. In the footsteps of photographer Daniel Leite will be followed by a small team — which, with the necessary setback, will film these encounters. These same steps will be followed by the past, very closely with pictures the photographer produced in 2006. Whenever necessary, stories and images from the past will gain the screen, either by telling curiosities, or showing, through the contact sheet that will gain the canvas, the photographic step by step until the photo that he judged to be the main one.\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/MM1pQio.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/426341855?embedded=true&source=video_title&owner=2297917)\n\n\n.\n\n\n# What we will deliver\n\n1. * **Nouns will sign as the sole sponsor of all works**\n1. * **The logo will appear on a animation card before the movie starts**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/buYkVSY.gif)\n\n1. * A feature film of at least 90 minutes entitled “More past than future”\n\n1. * The logo will be present in all publicity material for the feature.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/o7EPDLq.jpg)\n\n1. * **A short film in a making-off style of at least 20 minutes, showing the entire process of the film, from capturing by Nouns, building our legacy and shooting the film.**\n1. * A 300 page black and white photo book telling what happened in the lives of the characters that will be re-photographed. Before and after portraits and small text extracts that punctuate the transformations of their lives in the span of 17 years.  Note: The book will be sold and all proceeds will revert to the village of Kabadio\n1. * **A Nounish action with the village football team (More details below)**\n1. * Photographic exhibition / Vernissage / Launch of the feature and book in RJ\n1. * **Entry of the feature film and short film on the world circuit of film festivals**\n1. * **All proceeds from the film will go entirely to Kabadio.**\n1. * Professional press office working on the promotion of the film\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/m0jKyqO.jpg)\n\n# The legacy\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zMhlAWP.jpg)\n\n\nThe Casamansa region is a conflagrated region, there is a separatist war there that has lasted more than 30 years. The young people of Kabadio are leaving the village for Europe, through illegal and very dangerous routes. Some manage to finish the path, but they are shocked by the illegality in Europe, others disappear.\n\nThe rural exodus is currently one of the biggest problems in the region and that is why the Permakabadio association works directly with young people in order to avoid choosing this path.\n\nAmong the countless activities offered by Permakabadio, it was in football that they found their greatest strength. Called Asc Bindoula, the association's team was created in order to develop the concept of youth belonging to a much larger context.\n\nMore than 20 athletes work hard throughout the year with the aim of classifying the team in the biggest competition in the state of Casamansa, Intervilarejos, the real World Cup in the region.\n\nTaking place during Senegal's monsoon, one of the most difficult times of the year, where life becomes slow and all locomotion complex. Intervilarejo is a breather and a portal to a new competitive and festive reality.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LIC6Maz.jpg)\n[Permakabadio's Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permakabadio)\n\nOur goal is to bring even more strength to the team and its athletes, so we want to sponsor the team next year through the following actions:\n\n* Buy of a new uniform with Nouns as a sponsor\n* Buy of sports equipment for the team (balls, cleats, shin guards…)\n* Workshop with local experts, players, coaches.\n* Renovation of the Kabadio football field\n* Construction of ASC Bindoula's CT (Meeting and Study Room)\n* Library around sports and decolonial themes\n* Buy a laptop for the trainer\n* Buy of a projector to be attached to the laptop for use in viewing games and tactics\n\nAll the amount raised with the release of the first feature was fully transferred to the village in the form of resources or support for projects.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AvhUsXB.jpg)\n\n\n\nWe facilitated the arrival of energy to the Bindoula permaculture farm, which today has 20 young people working directly in its operation. We helped in the construction of the Community Bakery located on the same farm, we donated half a ton of flour in order to speed up their bakery activities. In addition to donating food to the community and helping with emergencies in the village.\n\nIn this new project it will be no different, all the amount raised will be fully reverted to Kabadio and the maintenance of the legacy that Nouns will leave in the village.\n\n# Why Nouns should fund this proposal\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/K1ZKVE5.jpg)\n\n\n “More past than future” talks about a people, a little visited part of Africa. Giving voice to its population is to bring out our ancestry, as it was from the Senegambia sector (where Kabadio is located) where the first Mandinga enslaved in the Africa x Brazil diasporic movement came from.\n\nThe potential of this project was already proven in our first feature, in which we were present in more than 40 film festivals, passing through 12 countries and remaining in the Amazon Prime Video documentary catalog for 2 years, being watched by more than 300k people worldwide.\n\nOur bonds are not frivolous, our relationships are not ephemeral. We have followed the life of this village for more than 15 years and we intend to participate more and more in its development.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1qJC2Tf.jpg)\n\n\nSponsoring our documentary and book gives Nouns the opportunity to take their glasses into the most prestigious film festivals in the world, project their brand into the streaming universe, participate in an arts publication of historical importance and thereby affirm even more the strength of the community and its ability to be involved in big projects.\n\nIn addition to the public understanding the importance of Nouns in carrying out these artistic projects, they will understand that it was the initial vector for a legacy that belongs to the village. The films and the book make up an archive that will be entirely dedicated to the village's causes until the end of time.\n\nOur cinema is humanitarian, all resources captured in this proposal will be donated to the village of Kabadio, located in the south of Senegal in the region of Casamance. Moving the local economy and leaving a true legacy for the people.\n\n# Budget\n\n**The amount requested is to finance the project for one year of work**\n\n**90 days** of Pre-production\n**45 days** of Recording \n**3 months** of Post-production \n**6 months** of Promotion *(festivals, streamers, social networks, newspapers, magazines and websites)*\n\n* **Team** \n    * Director / Director of Photography (Daniel Leite) - 5 ETH\n    * Director of Photography SEG UNIT (Felipe O'neill) - 2.5 ETH \n    * Sound Director (Wilson) - 2.5 ETH \n    * Camera Assistant / Logger (Hugo) - 2 ETH\n    * Producer / Director of Making Off (lcsant) - 5 ETH\n    * Local Producer (Mamadou Diop) - 2 ETH\n* Total - 19 ETH \n \n* **Equipment rental**\n    * Camera lenses and accessories - 2.5 ETH \n        * Black Magic 6k pro with extra batteries and cards\n        * Tripod Manfroto 504hd\n        * Fixed Lens Zeiss zf 18/25/35/50/85/100mm f:1.4 to f:2.8\n        * Lens Zooms: 24:70 / 16:35 / 70:200mm f:2.8\n        * TV Logic 5' monitor\n    * Sound equipment - 1.5 ETH \n        * Sound Device Recorder 788t\n        * Sound Console DeviCE CL-8\n        * BPL 130 vmont battery\n        * Sony urxb2 tx\n        * Sennheiser ew100g4 kits\n        * 1 boom pole -- ktec avalon CARBON\n        * Neumann Kmr 81i\n        * Haness orca or 40\n        * Tentacle sync box\n        * Electronic clapperboard deneck ts3\n    * HDs - 1 ETH\n* Total - 5 ETH \n\n* **Logistics and Production**\n    * Plane ticket Brazil X Africa - 7 ETH \n        * 5 two-way team tickets \n    * Local Transport - 2.5 ETH \n        * 2 car rental with local drivers for transport during the 45 days of travel\n    * Local Stay - 3.5 ETH \n        * Stay for a crew of 6 during the 45 days of shooting\n    * Food - 2 ETH \n        * Food for a team of 6 people during the 45 days of shooting\n* Total - 15 ETH \n\n* **Post production** (Budget for 3 months of post production)\n    * Film Editing 4 ETH \n    * Making-off Editting 1 ETH\n    * Sound Mixing 2.5 ETH\n    * Motion Designer 1.5 ETH \n    * Translation and Subtitles 2 ETH \n        * Both the film and the making-off will be translated and subtitled into Portuguese and English\n    * Photo book printing 4 ETH\n        * Writing / Revelation / Scanning: 2 Months\n        * Design/ Printing: 1 Month\n        * Distribution: 3 to 5 Months\n    * Film Disclosure 3 ETH\n        * 6 months of Promotion *(festivals, streamers, social networks, newspapers, magazines and websites)*\n* Total - 18 ETH\n\n* **Kabadio legacy**\n    * Purchase of a new uniform with Nouns as a sponsor 2 ETH\n    * Purchase of sports equipment for the team (balls, cleats, shin guards…) 1 ETH\n    * Workshop with local experts, players, coaches. 1.5 ETH\n    * Renovation of the Kabadio football field 2 ETH\n    * Construction of ASC Bindoula's CT (Meeting and Study Room) 3 ETH\n    * Library around sports and decolonial themes 1 ETH\n    * Purchase a laptop for the trainer 1 ETH\n    * Purchase of a projector to be attached to the laptop for use in viewing games and tactics 0.5 ETH\n* Total - 12 ETH\n\n* **TOTAL PROPOSAL** \n   \n   **69 ETH** \n\n.\n\n**Proposed Transactions**\n\n0x207a97e0d3339059C555D04374499c03Df47775D - lcsant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n# Who is making the proposal - Lcsant\n\n**https://twitter.com/lcsant_eth**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/cpqP0c5.jpg)",

Already in conversations with iconic musicians and reputable foundations- we will make a major ripple in the lives of musicians, music fans, music education and overall- **Nounish proliferation.** \n\nOver a 6 month period, our goal is to onboard and empower musicians, build upon the existing Noun Sounds platform, create a DAO structure and develop new systems for **musicians and music lovers to create, share and participate in Noun Sounds**- building a self-sustaining community around all things music.\n\n## **Total: 245.5 ETH**\n\n*(See bottom of proposal for funding breakdown)*\n\n## Proposal Outline\n\nFrom January-June 2023, Noun Sounds Pod will:\n\n→  **Empower + Onboard Musicians** \n\n→  **Further Develop Nouns Sounds Platform** \n\n→  **Nounish Partnerships** \n\n→ **Create Noun Sounds DAO**\n\n## Empowering + Onboarding Musicians\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DvdegTr.jpg)\n\nOne of our top initiatives is to empower musicians through funding and community building.  Our initial conversations include: \n\n- **Large-scale Artist 61ETH**\n    - **Ghostface Killah from Wu-Tang Clan:** *in discussions about making a CC0 song and sound pack for Noun Sounds + a photoshoot with the Noggles glasses.  Ghost has millions of fans and he digs the Noggles.*\n    \n        - *If the collaboration with Ghostface Killah does not happen, the full 61ETH will be sent back to NounsDAO*\n\n- **Indie-artist 23ETH**\n    - **Lisa Caruso:** *A talented indie artist from Australia, Lisa has had her music featured on major network TV shows and has released a slew of cool music and visuals.  Our plan is to create a Nounish E.P. and sound pack with her + a mini-doc following her creative process.*\n- **Prop House x Noun Sounds 19.5ETH**\n    \n    We will be leveraging Prop House rounds for musicians to onboard new talent for songs, sounds, music videos and more.  One Prop House round every month for 6 months:\n    \n    - **2ETH x 5** - *Musicians will submit their music catalog and NS voters will choose (5) artists to make a new Nounish CC0 song/beat.*\n    - **1ETH x 5** - *Musicians will submit their music catalog and be hired to create a CC0 sample pack containing loops and samples.*\n    - **.5ETH x 4** - *Creators can make a video for Save The Music with the purpose of amassing educational content for students (i.e. “How To Play The Guitar 101”).*\n    - **.25ETH x 10** - *Anyone can submit their audio catalog and NS holders will vote for artists to create new CC0 sound effects and real-world sounds (i.e. recording the ocean or other foley sounds)*\n\n## Further Develop Nouns Sounds Platform\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VmKPbpi.png)\n\nPart of our MVP was building out the PLAYground section of the Noun Sounds website.  Building upon this, we will be creating new tools and features within the NS platform as we grow our pod:\n\n- **Mint Playlists: The Nouns Player**\n    - Meet the **Nouns Player companion**: A free *“Winamp”-style audio player that will be able to pull music from Spotify, read from the playlists and allow you to enjoy each **curation**.*\n    - Creators will be able to mint playlists of songs and podcasts from their catalogues. Taste-Makers and Curators will be able capture a moment in time and create communities around each of them.\n    - This not only allows artists to create but also empowers one of the most important thing in music: **curation**.\n    - *Each Nouns Player will have the option of creating custom skins for their companion.* Thus, the Playlist Creator will come along with an **Album Art and “Skins” creator tool** for the music player.\n    - These playlists will allow creators and curators to offer token gated content (on their websites or through channels in their discords) based on each of their mintable playlists.\n- **Artist Profiles**\n    - *Artists and creators* will be able to setup their own custom page to showoff their catalogue and give updates. You’ll be able to read about their work, see what packs they’re just released, or check out what playlists are currently minting.\n- **Profesional** **Music Creator Tools**\n    - **VST Instruments:** *Offering tools to experienced musicians*, we will be creating professional instruments that can be used in music-making programs. From keyboards, vocals, synths, drums and more- music makers can download, install and get to making their own Noun Sounds within their existing audio workstation.\n    - **Soundboard:** A fully functional CC0 soundboard on Noun Sounds for use across all Twitter Spaces and more. One of our most requested features.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2og8Ys1.png)\n\n\n\n## Nounish Partnerships\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PH0pU8p.png)\n\nPartnering with **[Save The Music](https://www.savethemusic.org/)**, we will proliferate the good vibes via IRL impacts and educational experiences. Save The Music partners with school districts and local communities to build sustainable music programs. Noun Sounds will start by running a Prop House with STM and include the partnership in future DAO proposals, while assisting them in the web3 landscape. \n\n\n## Noun Sounds DAO\n![](https://i.imgur.com/lyE5x23.png)\n\nUsing the Nouns Builder, Noun Sounds will create a daily auction to onboard new users into the Noun Sounds ecosystem.  Holding a Noun Sounds NFT allows you to put proposals on chain, vote on proposals and have an overall voice in the direction of the Noun Sounds treasury and growth.\n\n## Costs Breakdown\n\n**103.5ETH -** Onboarding world-renowned and indie musicians via collaborations and Prop House rounds.\n\n**67ETH -** SuperTightWoody- DAO partnerships, operations, music/content production, music communications and community management.\n\n**67ETH -** Papaya - Platform upgrades, CC0 music onboarding flow, mintable “Winamp”-style Nouns Player tools: playlist maker via Spotify API and custom player “Skins” art tools, professional CC0 music tools: DAW/Kontakt VST and soundboard.\n\n**8ETH** - Reserved for lawyer fees; we will need contracts and legal advice on releasing creators music as CC0.\n\n## **Total: 245.5 ETH**\n\n**Multisig Wallet Signers (3/4):**\n*SuperTightWoody\nPapaya\nKerimbonia\nBehbodhi*\n",

          "reason": "Nouns Sounds was unanimous when it was a small experiment with a clear set of deliverables.  It went ok but it hasn't left our bubble yet and the community around it is pre-traction.  As a platform, it's very early and doesn't exist yet.  It doesn't warrant big spending (yet), it's still very much at the experiment level.  It's on this team to prove out much more before it's worth funding more.  It doesn't make sense for the DAO to take experiments and 5x or 10x the funding unless there's strong evidence that it was a clear win.  If this was \"continue to explore Noun Sounds\" and 50 ETH +  20 ETh for a CC0 music Prop House rounds, there'd be something to debate, but after this ask and the strategy, I'd lean No there.\n\nThere is serious issues here with strategy and not understanding that the partnerships with these famous musicians are not only very expensive marketing for a platform that isn't ready for it but also a poor fit for how to build a real organic CC0 focused music community of any kind.  You need people, small people, passionate people who vibe organically and don't need to be paid to vibe.  Find those people, engage them with Noun Sounds, build Noun Sounds and its community with them.  Money doesn't spend for that.\n\nWhen Proposers are getting paid by the DAO in other places, it's helpful and important to lay that out upfront.  The DAO deserves to know, the relationship is already so assymetrical, I expect our partners to be clear and WANT the DAO to be informed.  \n\nI'd also want to see Proposals be transparent when they have relationships with entities they are funding in the Proposal itself.  It would help to know that Woody has a relationship with Save the Music -- it means that execution there is more likely to go more smoothly.  It's also important because the DAO should know when there's the potential for related party transactions. It's small dollars here so it doesn't matter as much right now but STM was also was mentioned in that this team expects funding for future STM proposals, so understanding that relationship is important.  It also highlights the lack of cohesion and focus here -- STM future proposals for even more money but also focusing on expensive celebrity marketing but also working on a pre-traction platform that will live and die by passionate CC0 creators that are not either of the first 2 groups is an odd admixture.",

Based on feedback from the community, we’ve reduced the budget significantly, clarified our goals, provided product mockups, and answered open questions.*\n\ntl;dr: We’re asking for 190 ETH to fund 5 months of development for [House of Nouns](https://houseofnouns.wtf) v2. Our MVP has seen tremendous traction, growing 100% each month, and proving to be a critical piece of infrastructure for governance. Now, we’re looking to build the best-in-class pre-proposal client to kill Discourse, create a layer for generating Nounish ideas, open source our core infrastructure, and expand to all Nounish DAOs. This will return value to the DAO via better decisions, increased participation, powerful infrastructure that the community can build on, and proliferation of Nounish governance.\n\nWe believe that governance is THE bottleneck for Nouns’ participation and ultimate success. And we’re here to fix that.\n\nClick here to view this proposal on House of Nouns.\n\n# Background\n[House of Nouns](https://houseofnouns.wtf) was previously funded with 20 ETH through Prop House. Our mission is huge: fix Nouns Governance and empower its contributors.\n\nWe saw tremendous success in our basic MVP from October through December:\n- Discussion on House of Nouns that exists nowhere else\n- Usage (MAUs and pageviews) grew >100% month-over-month \n- Continual expressions of love and support from the community\n- A go-to client that streamlines governance and prop discussion\n\n![HON v1](https://collectivexyz-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/HON+v1.png)\n![Prop Debate](https://collectivexyz-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Prop+Debate.png)\n[(a debate on Proposal 202)](https://houseofnouns.wtf/proposals/202)\n\n# Deliverables\nOur MVP was just a small part of the vision for House of Nouns: a full suite of supercharged governance tools, for all Nounish DAOs, built on open source infrastructure that anyone can extend.\n\nHere are the key components we’ll build into House of Nouns v2.\n\n**Pre-proposal client.** Discourse is starved of life, and HON v2 will streamline everything that happens before a proposal goes on-chain, saving energy and empowering contributors to do their best work.\n- Rich discussion layer for getting feedback on a draft \n- Inline commenting on specific parts of a draft\n- Templates and multiplayer editor for creating proposal drafts\n- Ability to revise and re-release versions of a draft (like ProductHunt, or this House of Nouns prop) \n- Imported data from Discourse for backwards compatibility\n- One click to promote to on-chain, or have a sponsor do it for you \n- *(Note: see demo at top of prop)*\n\n**Ideas client.** Aligning the DAO on what matters is essential; we want to help contributors know what the DAO is excited about.\n- Reddit-like platform for generating, voting on, and rewarding ideas at the earliest stage\n- Backwards compatibility and integration with Prop Lot API\n- *(Note: see demo at top of prop)* \n\n**Open-source infrastructure** to enable the next 100 governance clients. HON v2 will eliminate all barriers to building on Nouns governance, and improve decentralization. We don’t want to be the last great governance client; we want to be the first of many.\n- API for all governance data, discussion data, Nouner profiles, and more\n- SDK for easy integration of client components to other platforms\n- Frontend repository for House of Nouns website\n- Technical documentation to help new Nounish builders launch their governance apps\n\n**Public good for all Nounish DAOs.** The success of Nouns is directly correlated to the success of Nounish forks; HON v2 will proliferate Nounish governance and drive value back to Nouns through forks (beyond ones created through Nouns Builder, like Lil Nouns, SharkDAO, etc) and branding ⌐◨-◨.\n- See activity from all of your Nounish DAOs in one feed\n- Keep track of all urgent to-dos and notifications across DAOs\n- Full House of Nouns functionality for all future forks of Nouns\n- *(Note: We’ve already been funded by Nouns Builder to support their DAOs. Extending to non-Nouns Builder forks is a minimal effort on our side, and neither of these integrations contribute heavily to this prop’s budget. However, we wanted to ensure that we committed to it explicitly here, because we do see it as an important public good to support a future ecosystem of diverse forks.)*\n\n**First-class integration with other Nounish tools.** HON v2 will be your single looking glass into the rabbit hole of Nounish governance.\n- Agora delegate profile data\n- heyanoun anonymous commenting\n- Federation DAO-to-DAO governance\n- Nouns Atlas search \n\n**New & improved core governance tooling.** You asked and we heard — we’ll be delivering a faster and improved experience on core proposal tooling. This includes an improved UI, much faster loading, notifications for new proposals, enhanced profiles, and other improvements.\n\n**Moving beyond.** We move quickly. While we don’t want to overpromise, we’re also excited to go above-and-beyond with **social media data indexing, contributor profiles, and a post-proposal client** once we ship our core objectives. These will provide richer context and data, more functionality for DAO alignment, and greater transparency for the community.\n\nMost of all, we want to make governance fun and easy instead of a chore.\n\n# Budget, team, and sustainability\nWe’re requesting **190 ETH for 5 months** for full-time development work from the team. After revising our proposal, we believe this is in line with standard service development costs seen in coming out to 9.5 ETH/developer/month.\n\nThis will be spearheaded by:\n- [dadkins](https://twitter.com/dadkins_): longtime crypto hacker\n- [Wojciech Kocjan](https://twitter.com/w_kocjan): frontend & design engineer\n- Jamal Hashim: ex-Amazon, blockchain engineer\n- John Cairns: longtime crypto builder, ex-Gemini\n\nFor the sake of transparency, House of Nouns is by Collective, which is a VC-backed company that has expertise in NFTs and community tooling (previously launched MomentRanks.com and grew community tooling to 50,000+ Flow blockchain users). That being said, we want to make sure this is a self-sustaining and fair investment for the DAO; as such, the end goals include open source infrastructure and self-sustainability for the product, and the budget reflects what we think is a fair pricing for development services.\n\nWe plan to offer bespoke upgrades to other DAOs similar to Red Hat’s monetization model, as well as charging hosting costs for larger communities.\n\nThese upgrades will be built into the broader platform and framework for all users. To reiterate, **Nouns will have permanent access to the product open-source base infrastructure from this proposal, and future upgrades for other DAOs will improve upon this base layer, meaning Nouns receives HON v2 and reaps the benefits of future compatible upgrades.**\n\n# Testimonies\n![Testimony 1](https://collectivexyz-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/testimony1.png) \n![Testimony 2](https://collectivexyz-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/testimony2.png)\n![Testimony 3](https://collectivexyz-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/testimony3.png)\n…and many more <3 ",

That’s why we’ve geared this prop to deliver an entirely open-source, openly owned codebase — so there is no centralized value capture, and anyone can host, build on top of, and monetize the end deliverables. We think this completely aligns incentives and will help build a strong, open ecosystem.\n\nWhat does open sourcing mean here?\nThis means everything from the repo to the APIs will be open access, so people with varying levels of technical acumen can clone and re-host and build on top of House of Nouns. We’ll also be doing continual data dumps to Arweave for any offchain data.\n\nBudget?\nWhile ETH is going up in price, we’ve decreased our prop’s total cost by ~$100k. We heavily increased deliverables and the speed at which we deliver them. We’re looking for 9ETH/month/developer, which is less than any other active developers for Nouns. We think that deliverables and actual matter the most, and think they are very justifiable for the cost of 190ETH in terms of the long-term impact they can have on the DAO’s success.\n\nIntegrations?\nWe’re looking to be as open and composable as possible. We want to integrate the amazing work of others everywhere it makes sense, versus create clones and replicate any functionality. We want to be a bridge between the disjoint governance infrastructure in the ecosystem.\n\nThank you for your time sers <3",

While the treasury has been well capitalized thus far, we’ve seen the Nouns auctions drop from an average price of ~80Ξ → ~30Ξ. At the same time proposals have been increasing in scope and complexity, requiring more funding.\n\nFor the DAO to continue operations at its current scope and with its current vision, **we need to start putting more emphasis on treasury growth and self-sustainability.**\n\n\n\nThe recent stETH ([#217](https://nouns.wtf/vote/217)) proposal was well received by Nouns members, a great indicator that a majority of the members are interested in safely increasing the DAO’s available capital.\n\nAs of today, NounsDAO has ~5-10% of the treasury in Lido and it’s yielding ~18Ξ per month or 215Ξ annually (equivalent to ~7 auctions). This is a great first step to increasing the treasury without assuming too much risk onto the DAO, as Lido is one of the most trusted staking providers, managing billions of ETH.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9ov5I1Q.png)\n\nThe next logical step is to productionize the stETH in the treasury as well. We plan to do that by creating the **Nouns Treasury Management**.\n\n## The Team\n\nThis proposal is brought to you by 0xPiney.eth, ramenboy.eth, and pinkglasses.eth. Collectivey, we’re known as 1560 Studios. The sum of three Nouners united to produce Nounish infrastructure that will maximize DAO efficiency and potential.\n\n- Noun 575 (0xpiney.eth) - All things on-chain and smart contracts\n- Noun 576 (ramenboy.eth) - All things web + design\n- Noun 409 (pinkglasses.eth) - All things DeFi and Decentralized.\n\nWe are industry veterans who have worked in big tech and exchanges before diving into the web3 ecosystem exploring NFTs, DeFi, and DAO’s. Since the start of the year, we’ve been working full-time to create all things Nounish and decentralized.\n\n\n## **Nouns Treasury Management (NTM)**\n\nNTM is a bespoke solution for NounsDAO that will manage a portion of the treasury and be completely governed by NounsDAO - a decentralized asset manager.\n\nStrategies can be created by absolutely anyone. Our aim is to create truly decentralized asset management infrastructure that can be used by anyone and everyone, with the approval from governance. We’d like to kick off NTM with a pilot program that’ll serve as a foundation for future yielding strategies.\n\n\nFor the pilot program, we want to focus on creating yield from the current stETH sitting in the treasury. We want to focus on stETH for 2 main reasons:\n\n1. **stETH is not used for proposal funding, and ETH withdrawals have yet to be unlocked.** Even after Shanghai is merged, there will be withdrawal queues in order to convert the stETH to ETH. The DAO’s stETH will be ‘sitting’ in the treasury for the foreseeable future. This creates an opportunity for us to yield in the meantime.\n2. **The most battle tested protocols with huge TVL’s support stETH.** This allows us to generate yield using relatively low risk strategies.\n\nNTM is inspired by Yearn vaults which currently hold over $400M in AUM (and peaked at around $6B AUM). These contracts are extremely battle tested and a reference in the yield aggregator domain. NTM’s general architecture will look like this:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nyYNq3M.png)\n\n**The key contracts + terms:**\n\n*Preface: For security reasons, all contracts will be **audited** and non-upgradeable. No proxies anywhere.*\n\n`Vault`: A contract that stores 1 asset (ETH, stETH, USDC, etc). Vaults manage the assets by deploying them into various yield bearing strategies. All vaults will:\n\n- be ERC4626 compatible\n- have privileged access to NounsDAO\n- be withdrawable by NounsDAO at any point (pending governance vote).\n\n`Strategy`: A contract that implements a yield bearing strategy - eg. take stETH and LP it into Curve, and sell the Curve emissions daily into ETH. Vaults deposit assets into specific strategies; ergo, the DAO sets the desired strategies employed.\n\n`NounsVaultManager`: The NounsVaultManager creates vaults and manages the strategies and assets used within the vaults. The DAO will interact with the Vault Manager through the TransactionBuilder.  All these vaults are ERC4626 compliant and deposit/withdrawals will only be able to be accessed by the DAO (TransactionBuilder).\n\n`NounsStrategyFactory`: The factory that creates different strategies for assets.\n\n## Yield **Strategies for the Pilot Program**\n\nNTM is first and foremost a **platform** that is completely governed by the DAO. Any Nouns members is able to create a strategy for any existing vault and the DAO can vote to accept the strategy or not - a completely democratic and Nounish treasury manager.\n\nFor the pilot program, we have researched a few strategies taking into account yield + risk for the treasury. While there are a wide range of possible strategies that take into account different models for analyzing risk/reward, we see these first two strategies as being ideal for the pilot program of NTM.\n\n1. **LP stETH <> ETH into Curve.** Today, 90%+ of stETH <> ETH swaps go through Curve. By LP’ing into Curve, we’d get returns from supplying this market.\n    - **Yield:** Low to Medium (~2.5% APY currently with $LDO emissions). ~125ETH ($200K USD) yield in 1 year with our stETH in treasury.\n    - **Risk:** Low.\n        - There exists two main risks with this strategy:\n            1. stETH depegs. We’ve seen stETH deviate away from ETH so this is a potential risk the DAO would assume. stETH and ETH are expected to trade closer to - if not exactly 1:1 once Shanghai is deployed, since stETH will be directly redeemable. \n            2. Curve gets exploited. We see a minimal risk of this due to the time these contracts have been deployed on-chain, and the audits performed on them.\n\n    If the peg diverges by a significant amount, we may see a different amount of stETH to ETH in our LP position. Past attempts from external actors to destabilize stETH in the past resulted in the peg converging to a 1:1 ratio regardless, with interesting returns for the LP’s.\n\n    When exiting or entering said strategy we would pledge both assets in order to minimize negative slippage (pledging ETH <-> stETH instead of just stETH).\n\n    **Strategy #1 Summary:** Interest generated by this strategy could (at current APY) help fund the cost of grants at a rate of 10 ETH/month, while exposing the DAO to minimal risk by using a trusted protocol with already $5B in TVL.\n        \n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/RwkzZm0.png)\n        \n2. **LP stETH <> ETH into Balancer and stake into Aura Finance.** Balancer is a popular DEX and Aura Finance is similar to what Convex is to Curve (governance and emissions from Balancer).\n    - **Yield:** High (~8-10% APY currently with $AURA and $BAL emissions). 400 ETH (600K USD) in 1 year.\n    - **Risk:** Low\n        - There are three main risks associated with this strategy:\n            1. stETH depegs. See above.\n            2. Balancer gets exploited: Same reason as Curve above - battle tested DEX + has been operating with hundreds of millions in TVL. \n            - Aura gets exploited: Aura has had extensive audits done to its contracts, works closely with Balancer, does continuous code reviews, and holds $450M+ in TVL.\n        \n    Similar to Strategy #2, we’d be earning additional yield by depositing into a second order protocol. Based on the amount in TVL and the similarity of the smart contracts with Convex, the risk profile is very similar.\n        \n    We would, however, need to sell (harvest) 3 separate tokens. This would potentially increases the gas costs of this strategy, but the rewards being ~3x the Curve strategy would cover any increase in transaction fees.\n        \n    **Strategy #2 Summary:** With this strategy we could generate 32 ETH per month. This would be enough to fund the Nouns Prop House in its current form without any drains on the treasury.\n    \n![](https://i.imgur.com/UBWLngv.png)\n        \n## Timeline + Ask\n\nWe believe implementing these two strategies will be the most fruitful for the pilot program based on risk <> reward. We estimate it will take ~1 month for the implementation of NTM, auditing of contracts, and implementing the new treasury page.\n\nWe are asking for **65ETH** from NounsDAO to implement the above, with an additional **100 ETH + 100 stETH** that would be used to pilot this project (with future expectations to allocate more capital to NTM if the results are favorable). These pilot funds will first be sent to a multi-sig with trusted Nouns members (see below), until the NTM contracts have been audited and deployed.\n\nThe funds will go towards:\n\n- **Contract audit** (30 ETH for C4 audit).\n- ~11 ETH each (3 members) to get this version of NTM into production (implementation + audits) + treasury page. We estimate this will take ~1 month.\n\nFollowing the launch of the pilot program, we’d be requesting:\n\n- 50% of all yields (**no principal**) will go to 1560 studios until we hit **175 ETH.**\n- After we hit 175 ETH, we would take a 2% management fee on further generated yield (no principal).\n\nTo emphasize, we want to profit alongside the DAO, in order to properly align incentives. Rather than making a large ask and risk t, we’d prefer to win if our output is legitimate and positive-sum.\n\nWe’re excited about the idea of working on this, and we hope to deliver a treasury that’s more capital efficient and less dependent on primary sales for funding. **This proposal is the first step in NounsDAO becoming 100% fully self-sustaining.**\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\n1. If the pilot program proves to be profitable and well-received, we will submit another proposal to allocate more stETh to NTM for the current strategies.\n\n2. The team will continue maintaining NTM and researching new strategies alongside Nouners.\n    - We will be actively taking feedback and working with any Nouners that are interested in developing strategies.\n    - A low hanging fruit could be to create a strategy to productionize our lil nouns by LPing them into Sudoswap.\n    - Design and UX is a huge focus for us so we will be constantly improving NTM and the treasury page.\n\n3. Following the initial development of NTM, we want to generalize it as a service (we've acquired [ntm.wtf](http://ntm.wtf) as the domain) for every on-chain treasury. We're going to be actively listening to feedback and speaking with Nouns members about how to build this in a way that properly benefits Nouners and the DAO itself. \n    - Prophouse like plug and play service for other treasuries to generate yield using NTM.\n    - Potential kickbacks back to the DAO for every new DAO integration.\n    - Push NTM to be premier on-chain treasury management service for all DAOs.\n    - To foster conversations about self sustainability, we will be sharing frequent updates of new developments and ideas. \n\n4. Our team is dedicated to building infrastructure and tools that proliferates all things Nounish. Stay tuned!\n\n## Proposed Transaction Description\n\nWe'd be sending:\n- 65 ETH to our team wallet (0x79f08F2e75A8C99428DE4A2e6456c07C99E55da5) to cover audit and development costs.\n- 100 ETH + 100 stETH for the pilot program to a 5/5 multisig (0xF4B99Bfb0500c6b1141DF1E0B7ED86c6e19B0ca6) with the following owners:\n    - 0xpiney.eth\n    - ramenboy.eth\n    - pinkglasses.eth\n    - El4d.eth (Verbs team)\n    - Yitong.eth (Agora core member)\n\nThe funds for the pilot program will be sent to NTM as soons as audits are done and contracts are deployed.",

      "description": "# Enabling a zero-fee NFT to NFT exchange for Nouns and beyond\n\n![https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-1.png](https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-1.png)\n\n## Goal\n\nEnable zero-fee inter-collection trading/swaps for Nouns and Nouns derivatives while funding a self-sufficient tool for other collections to trade NFT to NFT.\n\n### Why?\n\nNoun “OTC” trading is currently inefficient in a web3 environment and is usually done in Discord or other social media. On-chain execution can be coordinated with an added layer of curation/search to simplify these otherwise complex trades. Interested in a noun for 100 lil nouns + 15ETH?  Looking to swap your punk for two nouns? Looking to pay additional WETH to trade your higher noun ID for a sub-100 ID? These trades can be posted to the atomic0 exchange with no fees, be executable by anyone, and can all be open at once until one of them is filled.\n\n**Today, there is no NFT-to-NFT exchange, only OTC trading tools. Nouns can enable this radically new style of trading, which is uniquely possible with NFTs while incentivizing Nouns proliferation.**\n\n## The proposal\n\nAcross the entire swap exchange experience, the benefits of Noun-involved trades are highlighted:\n\n![https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-2.png](https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-2.png)\n\nThe atomic0 team will use funding from this proposal to meet the deliverables and timeline (below) **and guarantee zero-fee swaps where Nouns + derivatives are involved for the lifetime of the atomic0 exchange**. Where Nouns swaps are found throughout the experience, for example, on an individual punk page with a Noun-involved swap, the swap is highlighted as being a “Nounish” zero-fee swap. Swaps comprised solely of non-Noun assets (BAYCs, Punks, etc.) will be subject to a 0.5% gross fee on the estimated value of the swap.\n\n### Implementation details and mocks\n\nIndividual punk page with an example of noun proposed bids/swaps:\n\n![https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-3.png](https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-3.png)\n\nAsset selection:\n\n![https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-4.png](https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-4.png)\n\nThe swap creation page post-asset selection:\n\n![https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-5.png](https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-5.png)\n\n### Considerations\n\n- **No fees, ever, where Noun or Noun derivatives are included in swaps for the lifetime of the exchange.**\n- An infinite number of swaps can be created (using Seaport) without the NFTs leaving your wallet until an order is filled.\n- Supports multi-sig ([Safe](https://safe.global/)) from day 1.\n- Opensea “Marked as stolen” support/warning.\n- The exchange utilizes Seaport (and the Opensea conduit, so no approvals, if approved on OS), and NFTs don’t leave your wallet until a swap is executed.\n- We **plan to bootstrap with Nouns DAO funding and provide benefits to the Nouns DAO with our no-fee swap product. We plan on a sustainable long-term roadmap via fees (0.5%) on other collections where Nouns are not involved in trades (e.g., Wrapped Punks to BAYC)**\n- Additional proposals/products are possible with fee distribution back to the treasury after we’ve cut our teeth.\n- atomic0 is not yet VC-backed and is wholly founder-owned and operated.\n\n### Our Story with Nouns/web3\n\nWe launched a proof of concept zero-fee NFT marketplace which was the first on Ethereum to have both zero fees and [optional royalties (back in June)](https://twitter.com/atomic0Trade/status/1542282578291372032). Several Nouners used it to field OTC interest in their NFTs, but notably, [ayyybee used it to sell Noun #227](https://twitter.com/a0reverserekt/status/1565441676365029379), and [**vapeape (nounder) used it to sell his V1 Cryptopunk**](https://twitter.com/a0reverserekt/status/1563972653119025152). Many other traders and collectors in the space have executed trades on the platform, including [Franklin](https://twitter.com/franklinisbored/status/1574193716809662464), who actively lists his apes on [atomic0.com](https://atomic0.com/). While I don’t yet have a Noun, I’m [still closely watching and bidding on the auctions](https://twitter.com/robertjfclarke/status/1582833840447332353). Last month, we also built the [first WETH, non-custodial bidding solution for punks](https://twitter.com/atomic0Trade/status/1606001795985453057). This proposal was made possible with Noun delegations by [cryptopunks.eth](https://twitter.com/cryptopunks_ce) and [brennen.eth](https://twitter.com/brennen_eth). A big thank you to all the Nouns who gave feedback on this prop before it went on-chain!\n\n## Deliverables and timeline\n\n- Upon proposal execution → Noun fees are removed on [atomic0.com](http://atomic0.com) for all Noun listings, including derivatives.\n- Four weeks from proposal execution → Individual Noun to Noun or Noun to Other 721 (wrapped punks, BAYC, etc.) swap creation/execution enabled.\n- Eight weeks from proposal execution → Trait and ID array on the “want” side of trades enabled.\n- Stretch goal → Automated recurring emails with the top swap offers received for your wallet.\n- Stretch goal → Automated price adjustments and bulk swap creation when Seaport 1.2 is deployed on-chain.\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Why not build this as a stand-alone Nouns-specific website (e.g., nouns-swaps.com)?**\n\n- **We’ve seen project-specific marketplaces come into the fold recently, such as [Apecoinmarketplace](https://www.apecoinmarketplace.com/collections/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d) and [nounish.market](https://www.nounish.market/collections/0x9c8ff314c9bc7f6e59a9d9225fb22946427edc03). The utilization is near-zero compared with generalized marketplaces (Opensea, Looksrare, etc.). Embedding the aforementioned noun-specific benefits into the larger atomic0 swap ecosystem will incentivize and propagate nouns more than isolating noun swaps onto a Noun-only exchange. In other words, if people can also use the platform to trade their punks for apes, there’s a higher chance of Noun propagation due to incentives (no fees) for Noun-involved trades.**\n\nHow does this contrast with [Proposal 46 (Marketplace Pod Proposal)](https://nouns.wtf/vote/46)?\n\n- Our roadmap is entirely centered around enabling NFT to NFT trading, a stretch goal of proposal 46 ([noun.market](https://noun.market/)). Our deliverables focus on NFT to NFT, which makes for minimal overlap with [noun.market](http://noun.market)’s ETH to NFT focus. We see noun.market as complementary in some areas, including derivative identification for collection no-fee designation.\n\nWen open source?\n\n- We intend to open-source many components over time to allow for community contributions to the product, specifically on the front end. This will happen as we enable on-chain order creation and other helpful functionality throughout the development.\n\nHow does this contrast with existing OTC tools such as NFTTrader, Sudoswap OTC, and Swap Kiwi?\n\n- The websites mentioned above are great for situations where you’ve already found a counterparty for your swap. For example, you own a Noun, have fielded interest on Discord, and have found someone to swap your Noun for a punk. We take it up a notch with an exchange-style format allowing you to field interest across many collections and NFTs simultaneously. You could make the same noun swap offer to 100 punks of your liking, all at once, and have them all open and executable on-chain until someone fills the swap. We also support trait, collection, and ID-array bids and have many added layers of discoverability for swaps.\n\n![https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-6.png](https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-6.png)\n\nWill this require ongoing Nouns funding for maintenance?\n\n- Nouns support will sustain the platform's development through our roadmap mentioned above. Until fee-generating swaps from other collections, such as BAYC (where Nouns aren’t included), can sustain ongoing costs to operate the exchange. We may put through other proposals to add additional functionality or for long-term operational support, depending on community interest in the exchange.\n\nDo you have a plan for on-chain swap storage?\n\n- Off-chain swap storage is cheaper to implement and doesn’t require additional helper contracts, so we’re prioritizing them here for our MVP. We are open to implementing on-chain swap listings depending on the appetite, utilization, and community feedback. Fortunately, Seaport does allow for the storage of order hashes in their contract, so there is undoubtedly a path to implementation.\n\n## Team\n\n- [atomic0](https://twitter.com/atomic0trade)\n- [Robert](https://twitter.com/robertjfclarke) (co-founder)\n- [Alex](https://twitter.com/kiwi_dream) (co-founder)\n\n## Funding Logistics\n\n29 ETH to 0x12f3da22832ade66d63c624b8c40726db1124faf (atomic0.eth, a multisig controlled by Robert and Alex)",

From looking over the activity on a few secondary markets over the last 6 months, there has only been 27 sales total between OS, LooksRare, and X2Y2.

      "description": "# Social Network integrating Nouns, based on PunksClub.io\n\n**Goal**\nTo connect and integrate Nouns holders online & irl. We will create NounsClub, a social platform dedicated for verified Nouns.\n\n**Why?**\n\n* To connect Nouns holders around the world by location\n* To connect with Nouns holders during your travels\n* To potentially integrate Lil Nouns and other collections, based on Nouns community demand\n* To create profiles of Nouns holders online, show their bio and experience to promote the brand\n* To promote the Nouns brand by strengthening the community and showing it’s value to the crypto world\n* To be able to build together and share knowledge and interests according to their professions [ENTREPRENEUR, DESIGNER, INVESTOR, FOUNDER, DEVELOPER, UX DESIGNER ETC].\n* To organize and meet at events and local meetings\n* To be able to see what projects other Nouns are working on and collaborate on them\n* To be able to chat with other Nouns in chat rooms of all kinds\n* To create a large gallery of Nouns event photos and build the story of the community together.\n\nTo grow …\n\nIn order for Nouns to grow to its full potential, the community must grow first and foremost, the holders must have strong ties. This also increases demand for Nouns, as new potential holders want to belong to a vibrant community that has a lot to offer.\n\n**Our motivation**\nOur goal is to bring the Nouns community together, both online and offline, and help them extract maximum community value from the NFTs they hold. We offer them a social platform tailored to their specific needs that the current social media platforms don’t meet.\n\n**Our success story**\nAs of today, we have built two rapidly growing twin platforms, [PunksClub](https://www.punksclub.io), bringing together verified CryptoPunks holders, and [ApeClub](https://www.apeclub.ai), for BAYC/MAYC holders.\n\nOur efforts in numbers (5 months, fully organic growth):\n\n800+ verified CryptoPunk, BAYC, MAYC holders registered on our platforms\nOver 200 Punk & Ape holder meetings IRL thanks to our map feature\n70 holders’ projects listed on PunksClub and ApeClub\n3 events for Punks & BAYC sponsored and organized by us (London, NYC, Miami)\nOur platform will need some adjustments to be rolled out for Nouns, however it’s already live on the market, so there is no execution risk involved.\n\n**NounsClub**\n\nThe only such platform that brings together Nouns holders in one place and gives them the tools to communicate, collaborate, integrate irl. :point_down:\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Xg5EvhY.png)\n\nThe interactive map of Nouns holders. You can see who is in your city, arrange meetings, chat together. Are you traveling? Check who’s at your destination location and let others know you’re willing to meet up. :point_down:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MxDJ2fB.jpg)\n\n\nCheck out upcoming Nouns events around the world or meetups you can attend, grow not only your knowledge, but also your network. :point_down:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nsBAzNB.png)\n\n\nCheck out who has joined the club, where they are from, their background and what they are currently working on. :point_down:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VYpEOeX.png)\n\n\nContact your Nouns friends via chat. Group conversations according to interests, professions, in common projects, locations, events and also DMs. :point_down:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GiGBXiK.png)\n\n\n**Budget**\n\n29 ETH\n\nTo be spent on:\n\n* UX & UI designer to complete the look & feel\n* Development of any required tweaks (3 devs, QA, Project Manager)\n* Marketing efforts (our marketing team will actively promote the NounsClub platform)\n* Community team to help with member acquisition\n* Future maintenance\n\n**Milestones**\n\n* Needed feature tweaks, community interviews (2 weeks)\n* Design (1 week)\n* NounsClub development (~4 weeks, depending on changes needed)\n* Member onboarding with the help of our team (2 months)\n* Further maintenance of the platform indefinitely\n\n**Team**\n\nOur 11-person ApeClub team is led by two co-founders, web3 entrepreneurs with over 30 years of experience in tech, security & media markets:\n\nVoyTech.eth - 27 years of tech experience, built a 2 million+ social network in 2004 with funding from Intel Capital, so he’s an expert at building and scaling such platforms.

It seems like the tech is pretty much entirely built but just a new instance is needed for Nouns, and the funding ask seems kind of high given that. \n3. Given the product is already built and working for other communities, I think the team should try to find a way to monetize the product/find sustainable funding. That will give better info about if there is real demand and for what exactly, whereas DAO grant funding is not sustainable. ",

By setting this reverse record, anyone will be able to easily send anything to Nouns by simply inputting nouns.eth.\n\nThere are over [50 Nounish DAOs](https://nouns.build) that are donating a nounders reward to Nouns, and with [Prop 190](https://nouns.wtf/vote/190) we are now minting onchain. Unless you happen to know the Nouns address by memory it's not obvious.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gv9fthZ.png)\n[*Mint*](https://create.zora.co/collections/0x2209b665f7a875afccc80ff2834641ce82babd9a)\n\nAs Nouns continues to do things onchain (like setting up its ENS), it will be increasingly important that the community can easily recognize if something is coming from Nouns or not—setting the reverse record does just that.\n\nI've also added a 1 ETH payment to myself for the idea.\n\n⌐◨-◨ ",

      "description": "# Nouns Mail: A Token-Gated Email Address\n\n_Thank you to Lakshman Sankar and Maksim Stepanenko for delegating Nouns to submit this proposal._\n\n_We would also like to thank Prop House and Nouns voters for their support in [Open Round 13](https://prop.house/nouns/open-round-13/2392). This proposal serves to update the community on our progress and request the remaining funds necessary for the development of Nouns Mail._\n\n## tl;dr\nA token-gated email address for every Nouns holder to pseudonymously communicate and access the rest of the internet.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DpLdRUv.jpg)\n\n\n## The Problem\n\nNouns is the most interesting experiment happening in decentralized governance and community. Yet, large swaths of the internet remain segregated from on-chain identities. Currently, Nouners cannot connect their Ethereum wallets to access Twitter, collaborate on a Figma document, or even engage on the [Nouns forum](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/).\n\nEmail addresses remain a necessity to access most platforms on the internet. Existing email providers do not natively integrate with Nouns identity, compelling Nouns to manually link aspects of their on-chain identity to off-chain platforms.\n\nWe elaborate more on this problem and discuss solutions in [The Identity Gap](https://app.skiff.com/docs/3e5c70ba-ce96-48fb-a6e7-be34b6e6c77e#tFlZDTabPylC4WiIdCQ+dRLfE2ZoWZ/uUrqBlx7cUUM=).\n\n## The Proposal\n\nEvery Nouns owner will be able to claim a unique, token-gated email address under `@nouns.email`, or another domain decided by the DAO. Claiming this email address will be enforced by querying to an Ethereum node verifying ownership of a Noun.\n\n**Use cases**\n\nHere we suggest four initial categories of how our proposal can provide utility for Nouns. Should the proposal be accepted, we hope to assist in building out these use cases — like a weekly email newsletter or a `@nouns.email` domain-gated Figma.\n\nWe encourage the community to suggest additional use cases — Nouns Mail is a primitive that can unlock a Cambrian explosion of creativity.\n\nGreater utility for owning a Noun (through Nouns Mail or otherwise) increases the demand for minting Nouns or paying royalties on secondary transactions, leading to a larger treasury for the DAO.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Egs08Y3.jpg)\n\n\n**Implementation**\n\nNounsDAO allocates a domain to be used as the official email domain for Nouns holders. We suggest `nouns.email` because of its familiarity, but any reasonable domain owned by the DAO or available on the market would suffice.\n\nWe will be using [Skiff Mail](https://skiff.com/mail), an open source, end-to-end encrypted mail provider, as the interface and mailserver for the custom domain.\n\nAll emails sent and received by Nouns email addresses are encrypted with elliptic curve crypto (Curve25519 keypairs), and emails that are sent or received to other Skiff accounts (e.g. other Nouns holders) are end-to-end encrypted. Ownership of EOAs is verified by generating a unique challenge token, requesting an ECSDA signature, and verifying the signature’s validity. A full description of Skiff’s protocol and threat model can be found at [skiff.com/whitepaper](https://skiff.com/whitepaper).\n\nAs previously mentioned, verification of Nouns ownership occur by querying an Ethereum indexer on the [Nouns token contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0x9c8ff314c9bc7f6e59a9d9225fb22946427edc03?a=0x0bc3807ec262cb779b38d65b38158acc3bfede10#code).\n\n**Example User Experience**\n\nA user connects their wallet — if it’s detected that they own a Noun, a dialog prompts them to create their email address.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XIriCUL.png)\n\nAfter clicking `Claim email alias` , the page directs them to choose their unique Nouns email address.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DpLdRUv.jpg)\n\nAfterwards, Nouners will be free to send and receive email from this address.\n\n**Revoking Email Address Ownership**\n\nOne open question is what would happen to an account who sells or transfers his Noun after previously claiming his email address. Because owning a `@nouns.email` email address reflects one’s on-chain identity, it would be reasonable that ownership of this address is lost after losing the underlying Noun.\n\nTo implement this, Ethereum oracles on Skiff would listen for transactions where existing Noun email holders sell or transfer their last remaining Noun. Then, following an optional grace period, the email address would become disabled, becoming unusable until the account owns a Noun again.\n\n## Deliverables and Timeline (Post-PH Update)\n\n**Phase 1A: December 2022 [COMPLETED]**\nAfter Prop House Open Round 13, we successfully implemented the backend endpoints for Nouns Mail. You can view a video demo [here](https://app.skiff.com/docs/fc0a6f99-ebf3-4bfb-b724-6b70ee190103#XW5%2BD4uBTemlPZw4l3hmMaVlSn9npK4frGzDJQg8Bn0%3D) (this test account owns two other NFTs, but not a Nouns and therefore is unable to claim).\n\n**Phase 1B: January 2023**\n\nThe first phase will involve implementation of claiming Noun email addresses with the UX flow described above, including a full integration with the `@nouns.email` domain. We anticipate this taking around 2-3 weeks to fully build, test, and launch. Pending successful execution of the proposal, we are targeting a launch date of **January 20, 2022**.\n\n**Phase 3: February 2023**\n\nIn phase 2, we plan to take an active role in creating Nounish utilities based on Nouns Mail, including newsletters, domain-gated workspaces, and integrating better verification banners for the Nouns forum. We anticipate this process taking around a month, depending on the scope of utilities. We will launch these Nounish utilities as they are created, working actively with the community throughout development.\n\n## Team & Compensation\n\n[Joseph Zhang](https://twitter.com/trader___jo) - Designer, currently at Skiff and Azuki. Previously Apple, CMU design.\n\n[Richard Liu](https://twitter.com/richardyliu) - Engineer, currently at Skiff. Also contributor to IBC and Osmosis. Previously Blockchain@Berkeley, Figma.\n\nWe anticipate completion of phase 1 and 2, as well as initial maintenance and marketing, taking ~2 months. With one engineer and designer at a rate of 8 ETH per contributor per month, the cost of the [domain](https://nouns.email/) at ~3 ETH, minus the 1 ETH already awarded from Prop House, we are requesting **34 ETH**.\n\n\n**Revoking Email Address Ownership**\n\nOne open question is what would happen to an account who sells or transfers his Noun after previously claiming his email address. Because owning a `@nouns.email` email address reflects one’s on-chain identity, it would be reasonable that ownership of this address is lost after losing the underlying Noun.\n\nTo implement this, Ethereum oracles on Skiff would listen for transactions where existing Noun email holders sell or transfer their last remaining Noun. Then, following an optional grace period, the email address would become disabled, becoming unusable until the account owns a Noun again.",

I believe the prop made this detail ambiguous at best.\n\nI'm also concerned around a centralized location for Nouners' emails, this would be an attractive target for attackers.\n\nI wish the Skiff team the best and would personally be interested in playing with their platform, but I don't believe this proposal should pass due to the ambiguity around privacy.",

I am also not really compelled by the email-gated use cases: I think Nouns biases open, and I also think that the web3 integrations we see in Discord will be in a lot of other apps soon.

      "description": "# THE NOUNSVITATIONAL: Tier 1 Esports Event!\n\n*Nouns Esports is submitting this proposal on behalf of [Slacks](https://twitter.com/SirActionSlacks) & [Kyle](https://twitter.com/keepingitkyle) from WePlay Esports.* \n\n### Hello NounsDAO!\n\nWe are Weplay, a globally recognized Esports event company who specialize in creating groundbreaking productions in the world of gaming. From weekly shows with the NFL and top Twitch Streamers, to multi-million dollar Esports events such as the (Emmy Nominated) Dota 2  Animajor, we pride ourselves on making the most memorable and exciting events in Esports. \n\nNow, it's time for Nouns to have one of their very own: THE NOUNSVITATIONAL! \n\n## Please watch our short VIDEO PROPOSAL BELOW! \n\n\n\n[![https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pet9rHvlNs](https://i.imgur.com/IQh4GII.png) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhwg_nlX-w)\n\n---\n\n \n Short and sweet: we believe that an Esports event can take Nouns to new heights. We don't want to just show people some Noggles and call it a day - We want to enact a 3 step mass integration program designed around introducing (and integrating) the esports public at large into Web3, Nouns communities, and furthering the Nouns mission.  \n \n \n \n### Introduction \n \n We first learned about Nouns after your fantastic Dota 2 team entered the scene, and we got to know a few of the amazing folks over at the Nouns Esports crew. After doing our research on Nouns, we were impressed to find a group of people who were different from the normal Dota 2 Esports sponsors. In a scene plagued by Betting Companies, Scam Coins, and other nefarious evil-doers, it was refreshing to find a group of people using Crypto in a positive way; One that we would be proud to partner with to spread their message. Weplay prides itself on being the best in our industry and working with the best in their industry, and we believe that this project would be one of those partnerships. \n \n![](https://i.imgur.com/wb1Bub0.jpg)\n\n \n ### What we Offer\n \n What Nouns Proposals have been doing so far is great, but we believe we can do so much more for the growth of Nouns in the eyes of the general public. Many of your successfully executed Proposals in the past have focused on getting the brand of Nouns out there with general advertising methods of simply \"showing the brand\". What we offer is not only brand recognition, but brand integration, on a wide and universal scale. \n \nWe don't just want people to know what Noggles are. We want people to know about the Nouns mission, the point of a DAO, and to get people who have never heard of Crypto or NFT's (even people who actively dislike them) to see the Web3 world in a positive light by having them actively participate in a system designed around an event that we know they want to watch. \n \n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ay6mRjf.jpg)\n\n \n  ### The 3 Step Plan \n  \n  Our idea is simple: get viewers to come for the Dota, and stay for the Nouns.  ⌐◨-◨\n  \n1. ENTERTAIN\n\nCreating a custom, interesting Dota Tournament structure with a dual purpose of getting as many viewers as possible to watch due to its innovative nature, world class teams, and Dota's best Talent while also subtly introducing them to a DAO structure in a positive way.\n\n2. EDUCATE\n\nOnce they come for the world class Dota, educate them about Nouns with direct, custom created content which Nouns can use forever (Nouns explainers, DAO explainers, Web3 explainers, and even mini-docs about past successful proposals and interviews) which we will play in-between the games to show that Nouns are one of the good guys, and that this system is something they can be a part of\n\n3. INTEGRATE\n\nUsing a POAP system, and focusing on a \"Mini Dota DAO\" designed around people who have no idea what Web3 is or don't even have crypto wallets, we aim to make the \"scary world of crypto\" something that viewers actively participate in both rewarding and fun as they collect Dota 2 themed POAPs during the event. By utilizing in-game systems, viewers can even trade these POAPs for digital cosmetics in Dota 2, giving them real value to the average viewer. \n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MgG6sMz.gif)\n\n\n  ### The Event\n\n\nThe Nounsvitational will be a world class five-day Dota 2 Tournament featuring ten of the top teams worldwide with the best broadcast talent in the Dota scene held from February 14th to February 18th. This will be a Tier 1 Dota 2 event, and the first LAN in DotA since the International World Championships in October. This will be the long-awaited return of Weplay to the Dota 2 scene (voted best Tournament Organizer in the scene, even surpassing Valve, the game's creator itself), and the first non-traditional Custom Game Mode LAN in several years. Suffice it to say, this event is going to be EXTREMELY hype for the average Dota viewer.\n\nUsing our custom map makers, we will transform the Dota 2 in-game map to be a Nounish playground, full of memes, references, and general Nouns branding so that millions of viewers will see Nouns during the games themselves. Between the games, we will utilize our content creation skills to produce and air custom Nouns video content, which will educate the viewers on Noun's culture, structure, mission, and past projects. \n\nHeld in the Weplay Studio in Los Angeles, we will bring the best teams around the world to play, and invite as many Nouners and Nounsfolk as we can to be part of the audience, for a once in a lifetime exclusive and intimate experience. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jO0BL0g.jpg)\n\n\n### Integrating the General Public to Web3\n\nThe event itself will get people's attention: they will watch for the unique structure and for the world class competition. But our true goal will be to get the viewers to understand and integrate into the Nouns culture while they watch a fantastic event. \n\nOur plan for this is also 3 fold. \n\n1. Traditional Pre-Event marketing of Giveaways, pushing people to join the Nouns Esports Discord, follow the Nouns Social media, and even give away tickets to attend the event live. Combined with the content we create at the event, we will ensure that people WANT to watch the content we provide, so they can understand the \"scary world of crypto\"\n2. Contacting the best artists and creators in Dota to make custom Dota 2 POAP art, which we will give away to viewers who watch the event. This will not only drive up viewership, but with an integrated system where viewers can trade POAPs for in game cosmetic items, chances to win prizes, and other benefits, we will not only subtly introduce the average viewer to the world of NFTs, we will ensure that they have fun doing it and can trade them for real value. \n3. Creating a \"Mini Dota DAO'' prior to the event, which will not only advertise the event during its duration on Reddit and other platforms, but show the general viewers that not all NFT and Web3 projects are \"bad guys\" and that the Nouns protocol is something that is actually cool, using a real tangible example that makes the Dota 2 community a better place. \n\nWe believe that by letting the viewers not just watch the Event, but actively participate in the event with POAP collecting, exchanging, and voting for how to \"better the world of Dota\" with a Nounish DAO system will achieve the greater purpose of the event. Come for the Dota, Stay for the Nouns.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DigBHGf.gif)\n\n### How does this Proposal Benefit Nouns? \n\n* All video content created for the event (the explanatory videos, documentary-like series, etc.) and the content from The Nounsvitational itself will be usable by the Nouns community as both \"proof of concepts\" and general media Nouns will be able to use forever. This media, especially explainer videos on what are Nouns, Web3, and DAOs, have great value for future proposal endeavors.  \n* Fantastic way to showcase current and past Nouns projects to first-time viewers in a captive audience. Can use already created media from other successful Proposals and expand on them with interviews from the people that made them happen\n* HUGE viewership and outreach to a variety of new, interested viewers in the world of Esports (a community that has a lot of crossover with Web3 already) in a positive, productive way in a scene that views other projects very negatively \n* Cements the Nouns brand in a very valuable space with tangible, easy to gather data showcasing sign ups, viewers, and active participants for future project proposals\n* Active (and trackable) onboarding of the general public to Web3 ideas and systems in a fun and dynamic way where they feel rewarded and positive about their experience, which is one of Noun's core goals   \n* Growing Nouns communities by incentivizing viewers to join for access to prizes, events, and other incentives along with getting them onboard with the general Nouns ecosystem\n* Come to LA! Nouns holders as well as Nouns community members can come and be part of the audience for the event, meet the players and the Talent, and have the experience of a lifetime!

SirActionSlacks has worked directly with Valve, the creators of Steam and Dota 2 in both Business Development and as an associate producer of The International, the Emmy award-winning 42 million dollar Dota 2 event since 2017. He has also created the only \"Alternate Game Mode\" events in Dota 2 history, including Midas Mode 1 and 2, Elimination Mode, The Captain's Draft Minor, and many others. While not making Dota 2 events, Slacks enjoys playing Dota 2 pubs and hosting/casting at events as Talent. \n\nKyle is also a Dota 2 Talent and former successful professional player who has been working to grow the world of Esports at Weplay behind the scenes on dynamic and groundbreaking productions such as the wildly successful Omega League and Dota 2 Animajor, an official Valve major. Kyle's brother was recently on the Nouns Esports team, and now ironically is on Slack's Dota 2 esports team. \n\nAs for Weplay, It's difficult to describe a company that prides itself on spectacle in a written format, so check out some of our content! \n\n[Augmented Reality Showreel](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JvFmuPpaIXUCe8nDQiQLTX36HPdL9BoM/view)\n[2021 General Event Showreel](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JvFmuPpaIXUCe8nDQiQLTX36HPdL9BoM/view)\n\n### Thank you! \n\nAs we said, we are big fans of Nouns and everything you are trying to do in the space. We truly believe that this event will not only be incredible for Nouns, but also be a fantastic and unforgettable experience for the people in the Nouns community that join us live, virtually, and the Dota 2 community at large. We hope you will consider our proposal and would love to have any comments, feedback, and suggestions. We want to build this event for you, but also build it WITH you, to make sure we make it as NOUNISH AS POSSIBLE! \n\nThank you\n\nSlacks and Kyle\nWeplay Esports\n\n---\n\n## ADDITIONAL INFO\nStill looking for some more, condensed information? Then please continue reading!\n\n\n### On Dota 2 \n\nCurrently, Dota 2 is the 2nd most played game on Steam, the biggest gaming platform in the world. It reaches a global audience with millions of active players each day, and even more viewers on it's Esports events. \n\nCurrently, Dota 2 is experiencing a resurgence of the most viewers and players since 2013! \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ayuGSsx.png)\n\nWhile most Triple A games and Esports require multi-million dollar fee to enter into the sphere with licensing fees and IP protection, Valve allows anyone to do anything with their games, giving full mod tools to players. This allows us to create a very Nounish event for a game with one of the highest viewership numbers in all of Esports. This event would only be possible in Dota, and Dota is our specialty here at Weplay. \n\nIn terms of reach and scale of viewers, the numbers are hard to come by as China and Russia have viewership data that is not easily accessible, but viewership of top events (such as The International and the Weplay Animajor) can reach into the millions from the English audience alone. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NI7SdaC.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ViAaXH3.png)\n\nFor a full breakdown of the Viewership of Weplay's last event, please [check out this link](https://escharts.com/news/weplay-animajor-stats) \n\n### On the \"Mini Dota DAO\"\n\nWe know the mission of Nouns is to gather together and pool resources to make the world a better place. But, the concept of a DAO and the betterment of society that can be caused their-in is something completely foreign to most people. To help the viewers understand (and subtly advertise the event) we propose creating a \"Mini DAO,\" a system that is modeled after Nouns itself! \n\nThe process is simple. At the start of the event, we announce that we will take a percentage of the prize pool and allocate that money to \"make Dota 2 better.\" Then, we will start a Reddit thread (Dota 2's primary community hub) where people are able to offer suggested Proposals for how to spend that money to make Dota better. During the duration of the tourney we will actively check in on this thread, promote it, and encourage people to add to the charitable donation if they wish for some in-game perks like having messages appear during the game on the in-game map. At the end of the event, we will have a vote and choose which idea the community suggested to allocate funds to and announce the winner. \n\nThe point of this is for the community to be HEAVILY INVESTED in the tournament and the suggestions in the Mini DAO, but more importantly by the end of this promotion they will VERY CLEARLY understand the Nouns structure and mission, without being simply told how it works.

Really excited Nouns can draw in people new to crypto and this quality of proposal. That said, I'm voting against. It’s a decent amount of ETH, both in absolute terms and as a % of the treasury. I don’t doubt that it is warranted for a quality event, but I think there are better ways the DAO could use the money. In particular, I am more interested in going deeper with our true fans than trying to reach out to a community that has historically disdained NFTs/crypto (the Dota subreddit responses to this proposal were not encouraging). I also felt a bit like the proposal was made to work for the proposers in a way that maybe doesn’t make the most sense for Nouns: the emphasis on using the proposer’s venue and the VIP Nouns experience. Finally, there were a lot of ideas here about how to use NFTs in the contest itself, but the proposers by their own admission seem to have little experience in the space. I think there’s a lot of subtlety here and it would take some real experience to get it right. Hope to see these proposers back with other ideas in the future! \n",

([https://nouns.wtf/vote/137](https://nouns.wtf/vote/137)).\n\n#### In the past 6 months, we have: \n\n[(click on thumbnail to watch video)![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/1561862008-6b0bb7f0c96ea6a1274f8d5a92c6e16018ac271a3dd958c59d0eb896f4a55a91-d?mw=1280&mh=720&q=70)](https://vimeo.com/778240986)\n\n\n\n[(click on thumbnail to watch video)![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/1561868158-9fbf38c98875938a4a0f09cbdf0e51d1219ed3e43269276bed7e29f33808b89c-d?mw=1500&mh=845&q=70)](https://vimeo.com/778244189)\n\n\n\n[(click on thumbnail to watch video)![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/1561716804-3360feb04da9e29f78f85da2dc88f4110188ae47a4829b62956a480df34894fd-d?mw=700&mh=1244&q=70)](https://vimeo.com/778159366)\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nCharitable efforts, social impact, and public goods are **cornerstone activities within the Nouns ecosystem**.\n\nNounsDAO **has funded a total of 1468 ETH for 19 proposals** related to charitable efforts/social impact through on-chain, NSFW, and prop.house. *_Data from proposal.wtf_\n\nPublic goods are an **essential** part of what Nouns is, not only helping society but making the community feel even more connected with each other. **The desire to help others and make a positive impact on the world**, for many people, is **a way to connect with others and create a sense of community and shared purpose**.\n\n**What are the main problems?**\n-   Nouns has yet to have a platform that leverages all of these impacts done by the community, content creation opportunities are not seized.\n-   As Nouns keeps growing and more public goods are activated, the need for a flexible framework that produces raw content of charitable efforts, public goods, and donations is a must within the ecosystem.\n-   There should be a platform that gathers community members interested in social impact and public goods.\n\n**Social Impact is one of the best ways to show any human what Nouns can do**. The power that **see good, do good** content has is too big to let it go to waste. So far, Nouns has been one of the most successful projects at integrating IRL to web3 impact.\n\nShowing everyone how a community can come together to help others and cooperate with each other, **a community connected by ⌐◨-◨**, is an excellent way to noun-pill newcomers.\n\nThis is where _**Nouns Love**_ comes in.\n\n![nounslove](https://i.imgur.com/Zo86psu.png)\n\n### What is Nouns Love?\nNouns Love is born from the interest of the Mucho Love’s team to **develop a global platform that uses content from social impact, public goods, charitable efforts to leverage the expansion of Nouns through social media content creation and storytelling**. Nouns Love will focus on in-real-life impact activations and public goods generated by the Nounish community.\n\nThe power that **see good, do good** content has is too big to let it go to waste. So far, Nouns has been one of the most successful projects at integrating IRL to web3 impact.\n\n**Nouns Love will increase brand equity by building a positive association with the brand in a widespread audience**.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4lw5YK7.jpg)\n\n### Transitioning to _Nouns Love_\nWe will start transitioning from Mucho Love to Nouns Love. Mucho Love will stay as a branch of Nouns Love for further social impact experimentation, public interaction, and testing ground of new ideas in the DR.\n\n**Nouns Love** aims to become a branch of Nouns that focuses on using storytelling, different narratives, and high-quality IRL content creation, which with the **see good, do good** content format **will expand Nouns to a global audience**.\n\nBy the end of the 4-month extension Nouns Love aims to be established as a fully functional platform.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5j9RvTb.jpg)\n\n### Mucho Love and international communities\nInternational communities will be using the model created by Mucho Love for its activations to test its adaptability. This will allow to take into account the inherent differences between countries, cultures, societal structures that exist throughout the world.\n\n**The communities that will test the model**:  \n◨ Uganda - led by Davin ([https://twitter.com/davinoyesigye](https://twitter.com/davinoyesigye))  \n◨ Mexico - led by Mono & Ale ([https://twitter.com/NounsDAOAmigos](https://twitter.com/NounsDAOAmigos))  \n◨ Germany - led by bk ([https://twitter.com/0xbk_](https://twitter.com/0xbk_))  \n◨ Spain - led by BlakeNeit ([https://twitter.com/blakeneit](https://twitter.com/blakeneit))\n\n**DR activations**:\n-   Knife RD x Mucho Love - “We cooked 100 children’s dream meals” ([https://www.instagram.com/kniferd/](https://www.instagram.com/kniferd/))\n-   Giving an entire community free hair cuts and essentials\n-   @sunsetco.rd x Mucho Love - “We took 10 families to see the beach for the first time” ([https://www.instagram.com/sunsetco.rd/](https://www.instagram.com/sunsetco.rd/))\n-   Techo RD x Mucho Love - [https://rd.techo.org/](https://rd.techo.org/) - Building a house for a family that lost it all to Hurricane Fiona\n-   Hugo Mendoza Children’s Hospital x Mucho Love ([https://hospitalhugomendoza.gob.do/](https://hospitalhugomendoza.gob.do/))\n\n**International activations**:\n-   A refugee dedicated to preserving the endangered Mexican donkey\n-   A volunteering event that will hand out food to homeless people around the city.\n-   A child care center for orphans and abandoned children to donate clothes, nounish educational materials such as books and pencils, toys, and dry stock food hampers.\n-   A city clean-up activation volunteering event.\n\n### Content creation and distribution\n**Every public good, social impact, and charitable effort has a unique narrative**. Through storytelling, all of these narrative can portray what it means to be nounish. Nouns Love will have its own in-house marketing team **to develop unique narratives through captivating, “see good, do good” style videos**.\n\n**The amount of raw content that can be produced from public goods, charitable efforts, social impact is immense**. The marketing team will receive raw content to produce high-quality content for social media distribution. The team will have constant brainstorming sessions with international community leads to deeply understand the particular narratives of every activation done.\n\nContent creation was one of the biggest challenges that Mucho Love faced, not having our own team that could develop our ideas, concepts, and styles was a huge limiting factor on our social media content capacity. **NL’s in-house team will allow us to 5x our content creation capabilities**.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZjHKKHM.jpg)\n\n### Development of a flexible framework\nDuring the past 6 months of activations, Mucho Love has made mistakes, created solutions, and changed formats. The amount of time lost by Mucho Love’s starting inefficiencies is very significant. Time-efficiency is the reason why we decided to develop a flexible framework for public goods, charitable efforts, and social impact.\n\n**A flexible framework that allows for better, smoother activations, therefore saving time.** The framework will take into account many minor details that may be overlooked which can lead to a poor activation and overall experience.\n\n**This framework will be tested by our international communities** that will be performing social impact activations during the following 4 months.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UvXE2KN.png)\n\n### Global synchronous activations\n**A global synchronous activation is an activity performed by many different communities that form the Nounish ecosystem in a certain time period**. These activations will target the same issue/activity and produce raw content for content creation.\n\nBy providing a platform for people to connect and interact in real time, global synchronous activities **can help to build relationships and foster a sense of belonging among members of a community**.\n\n**Nouns Love aims to portray the amazing work being done by nounish communities all around the world**. With storytelling, content creation, narratives, and marketing allowing Nouns to reach a wide audience.\n\nBy removing all barriers of crypto, web3, creating a wallet, discord, different websites, twitter, **see good, do good content** will be able to transcend as far as many hearts it touches in its path. Additionally, global synchronous activities will help build momentum and enthusiasm for a particular cause or issue, driving up engagement and participation within the community.\n\n### Social media & content distribution\n**We aim to expand Nouns Love to**:  \n◨ Youtube: Mid-length video format striving to combine storytelling with good animations, edits, and clips that will lead to the production of family-friendly, shareable, “see good, do good.” content.  \n◨ Tiktok: Short video formats with catchy hooks with the main point of spreading the ⌐◧-◧s through the platform. Making it easier for people who find the ⌐◧-◧s interesting to click the profile and access other social media where more information will be more easily found (Instagram, Youtube).  \n◨ Instagram: So far, Instagram has worked for us pretty well. A few flops and one fantastic post (a post with 67,000 likes), but it’s been great in general. Instagram will be the “face” of what NL stands for, does, and activates. We’ll also be using challenge formats to engage more people.  \n◨ Twitter: We’ll be using Twitter to make updates like “Today, Nouns Love donated 100 football kits powered by ⌐◧-◧”.\n\n**Combining youtube’s storytelling capabilities through mid-length content that engages viewers, TikTok’s short-form video with hooks that captivate the attention to the noggles, and Instagram as the face of NL, we believe that it’ll be only a matter of time & effort for us to reach substantially good levels in all these platforms**.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/a7I8VN1.jpg)\n\n### Budget Breakdown\n\n#### Social Impact Fund 84 ETH\n\n-   5 activations in the Dominican Republic (Mucho Love) (46.5 ETH)\n    -   Transportation, uniforms, volunteers activity, and third parties (6.5 ETH)\n-   4 pilot activations by international communities (16 ETH)\n-   1 synchronous international activation in all 5 countries (15 ETH)\n\n#### Marketing & Content Creation Team 39 ETH\n-   Video Editor\n-   Social Media Manager\n-   Animator/Illustrator\n-   Photographer/Videographer\n\n#### 16 ETH\n-   Retro-funding compensation for 4 core team members who have worked on Mucho Love for the last four months.

Ultimately empowering action sportspeople to uplift their communities with the first \"never-ending [expression session](https://www.surfertoday.com/surfing/the-history-of-the-expression-session-in-surfing).\"\n\n*ie. Our subculture's rendition of the [nouns virtuous cycle](https://medium.com/@punk4156/the-nouns-virtuous-cycle-95586bb9c7c9).*\n\n## 🤘 Gnars is Extremely nounish\n\n[Gnars](https://gnars.com) is an extension ([fork](https://gnars.wtf)) of Nouns dedicated to supporting the artistry of extreme athletes. We've [sponsored over a dozen](https://gnars.com/riders) skateboarders, snowboarders, surfers, scooter riders, inline skaters, roller skaters, skiers and an entire motorcycle club.\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/0DCX8jK.jpg)](https://twitter.com/nounish/status/1569692294529581056)\n\n[Since receiving 69 ETH to get started](https://nouns.wtf/vote/51) just 7 months ago, we've attracted millions of views on our nounish content, caught the attention of industry icons such as [Bob Burnquist](https://www.instagram.com/bobburnquist/) and have been onboarding people in *extremely nounish ways, like these 1.5M views with [Tom Rohrer](https://www.instagram.com/toms_tutorials/):*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QkY1C9e.jpg)\n\nMost recently we've been making a splash in Brazil thanks to our involvement with I LOVE XV, an annual skateboarding event in its 10th year. With [a budget of just 6 ETH](https://gnars.house/proposals/0xb63306dbfe950dd9754d5edcf8f48c6ff9bdd32eeeff4c644cb90c974a3055fa) those involved brought together 1000+ skaters in Rio de Janeiro to shred the biggest noggles ever made:\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/656PzQ6.jpg)](https://twitter.com/nounish/status/1593765220425486337)\n\nNot only did they produce terabytes of incredible content, our Brazilian crew provided the inspiration for this proposal. We learned that instead of just sponsoring individuals, we should empower them to uplift their communities as a whole:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JLwvCJb.jpg)\n\nNow we're an internet collective of over 750 members ready to actualise our subculture's rendition of the \"nouns virtuous cycle.\" We will establish the first \"never-ending [expression session](https://www.surfertoday.com/surfing/the-history-of-the-expression-session-in-surfing)\" to power our CC0 media machine.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/aObap4q.gif)\n\nGnars have funded [over 30 proposals](https://snapshot.org/#/gnars.eth), submitted the [first nounish DAO to DAO proposal](https://nouns.wtf/vote/142) ([origin](https://snapshot.org/#/gnars.eth/proposal/0x013702a15624613befa0ed1488350610f8d98c3d71c82e240183e8692600a5f9)), cast the [first nounish cross-DAO vote](https://twitter.com/0xWiz_/status/1589946679872360448) ([federation.wtf](https://www.federation.wtf/daos/gnars)) and have led by example to help countless nounish builders.\n\n## 🤯 Here's what 69 ETH looks like\n\nRather than bore you with the details, this timed open edition NFT is a highlight reel of what we've achieved since Proposal 51 passed. Click the embed below and it will take you to [our Zora minterface](https://create.zora.co/collections/0xdd930e878bdf23a78573998a451464c5bf56eeca).\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/IMAUuEA.jpg)](https://create.zora.co/collections/0xdd930e878bdf23a78573998a451464c5bf56eeca)\n\n\nPacking everything we've done into a 90 second video is near impossible, so we hope what made the cut serves as a memento for those who collect it. Many thanks to [4156](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1600505145397317634) and [Jacob](https://jacob.energy/predicting-provenance.html) who inspired our making of this compilation and its subsequent minting. Shoutout [Kai](https://twitter.com/m3thaverse), [Davin](https://twitter.com/davinoyesigye) and [Trizzy](https://twitter.com/trizzytrunk) for pulling everything together at short notice.\n\n## 🤔 What'll 694.20 ETH look like?\n\nBrazil taught us that cultural relevance is incredibly important. For example, the giant noggles you've seen people skating are permanently installed in Rio de Janeiro at Praça XV, alongside other iconic urban sculptures installed each year by Coletivo XV.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/uOAnnqd.png)\n\nOur giant noggles are in the same town square as the giant skateboard, one of the most photographed landmarks in Rio, third only to Christ the Redeemer and Sugar Loaf which are both globally recognisable.\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/H5xaVey.png)](https://twitter.com/0xigami/status/1598537522141069312)\n\nThe ability to do more activations like what we've seen in Brazil depends on the roll-out of the greatest onboarding effort Nouns has ever seen. Let's explore some of the ways we plan on scaling:\n\n### Builder onboarding via seasonal Prop House rounds\n\nGnars DAO has attracted builders who've paved the way with their creative approaches to activating their communities. Many hail from emerging markets where we can have an outsized impact and their values are already closely aligned with ours as crypto natives.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/uYMx45z.png)\n\n[Prop House](https://prop.house) allows us to run mandated funding rounds each season that will see builders competing for the opportunity to uplift their respective communities. Each round will fund activations as described below and we've already received expressions of interest from suitable candidates throughout South America, Africa, Asia and more.\n\n### Public goods delivery through builder-led activations\n\nBuilders funded each round will be equipped with everything they need for public goods delivery through thoughtful and culturally relevant activations. Leaning on our experience in Brazil, we'll help motivated individuals become local heroes.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/56iuFKh.gif)\n\nOur community will help them to implement nounish obstacles, crypto wallets and NFTs (10% of Gnars are for onboarding), merch and stickers, photo walls and banners, and to receive delivery of remuneration, Noun 189 skateboards and various types of noggles.\n\n### Hashtag campaigns to catalyse social media curation\n\nWe're not looking for \"[flash in the pan](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/flash_in_the_pan)\" type events and are committed to the pursuit of the \"[nouns virtuous cycle](https://medium.com/@punk4156/the-nouns-virtuous-cycle-95586bb9c7c9).\" We will leverage hashtags like **#ThatsGnarly** across all platforms to launch ongoing crowd-sourced social media campaigns.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/B82OcJz.jpg)\n\nSuch a rudimentary approach removes all barriers to entry so that the first step in joining the movement is simply posting to a hashtag. We can meet newcomers where they already express themselves, curate the best content based on impact and prepare creators for [a Web3 revolution](https://thatsgnar.ly).\n\n### Creator onboarding to the Gnars Revolution protocol\n\n[Revolution](https://github.com/collectivexyz/revolution) is a protocol from [House of Nouns](https://houseofnouns.xyz) (and [gnars.house](https://gnars.house/)) designed to enable the earning of governance rights through contributions other than capital. We are working closely with the team to give Gnars holders a reddit-like curatorial experience for content submitted to #ThatsGnarly.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wCsJkxJ.jpg)\n\nContent surfaces on a Web3 leaderboard at [thatsgnar.ly](https://thatsgnar.ly) after being submitted by extreme sports creators across social media. Competing in the \"gnarketplace\" for attention, top performing content is minted and sold as NBA Topshot style NFTs in daily auctions – *ie. Prop House for tricks.*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/fxNEx13.jpg)\n\n*Trick NFTs released under CC0, Gnars NFTs drawn from 10% of supply already allocated to athlete/artist onboarding and each GNAR is equal to one Gnars DAO governance vote.*\n\n## 🚀 How we'll spend 694.20 ETH\n\nWe're a passionate community with domain expertise who know very well the agility required to succeed. Our plans are subject to change and funds will be disbursed through our own proven governance, but this should give you some idea of what to expect:\n\n### Activations\n\nSkateboard production and shipping, existing skate park refurbishments, localised merchandise production, Nouns Vision and Bigshot noggles, fabrication of more giant noggles and so much more.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XQ5qksI.jpg)\n\n*Additional locations where sculpture installation is not allowed will be activated using NFC enabled \"⌐◨-◨\" beacons that prompt visitors to get involved.* \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2OGWJ1z.jpg)\n\n*This is a rough mockup of small indestructible noggle fixtures that can be glued discreetly at existing spots without degrading an obstacle's user experience.*\n\n### Autonomy\n\nSince inception, our community have had access to Noun 189 in order to participate in Nouns DAO governance. The time has come for Gnars DAO to acquire two Nouns of their own. Enough funds to purchase 2 Nouns will be allocated to auction bidding.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vD0S5Ty.gif)\n\nAdditional funds from our ongoing NFT auctions will bolster this funding request, further efforts laid out in this proposal, and allow us to continue onboarding professional team riders who represent us throughout their respective industries as ambassadors.\n\n### Contributors\n\nAs required we will provide remuneration through governance to top notch contributors already attracted to Gnars including [Gami](https://twitter.com/0xigami), [Alberto](https://twitter.com/alberto_campora), [Akva](https://twitter.com/Akva556), [Vlad](https://twitter.com/vladhzc), [Sam Mason de Caires](https://twitter.com/sammdec), [Brian](https://twitter.com/pbrianandj), [Rocketman](https://twitter.com/rocketman_w), [Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi), [Davin](https://twitter.com/davinoyesigye), [Satori](https://twitter.com/0xSatori), [Lochie](https://twitter.com/lochieaxon) and [Knowhow92](https://twitter.com/theocharis_ch). We will approach these engagements on a competitive basis much like our activations. \n\nWe've been working hard to gain qualitative insight and to establish the most effective operational structure. As a community we have access to unrivalled industry expertise through our relationships with pro athletes, artists, media and brands. We look forward to inspiring many more of our connections through the very same thing that's gotten us to where we are – word of mouth.\n\n> 📝 **NOTE:** Funding receival to [gnars.eth](https://gnars.wtf/), a [gnosis safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x0658f4eD17289144717713ADfFC2539eF7c2EF8e/settings/owners) multisig [governed by Gnars DAO](https://gnars.house/) members as described in [Proposal 51](https://nouns.wtf/vote/51) with backup signers being [Gami](https://twitter.com/0xigami), [Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi), [Oni](https://twitter.com/apenoun), [Noun 22](https://twitter.com/undeadnoun22) and [Blockbird](https://twitter.com/_blockbird).\n\n## 🛹 We're built for onboarding\n\n[I recently asked nouns twitter](https://twitter.com/0xigami/status/1596051642725830656), \"what is the biggest problem with nouns dao that needs solving?\" I was delighted to receive a response [from 4156 directly](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1596061577794330624): \n\n> \"same as every other crypto token imo: distribution. how to onboard maximum number of high quality, aligned etc. participants into the network\"\n\nOnboarding is something we take seriously at Gnars and we are uniquely positioned to onboard the next million [proliferatooooors](https://create.zora.co/collections/0x8c5effc5fb5d3805212713115427f4efe82a40be) by staying \"extremely nounish\" and applying the true grit and perseverance we've learned through our commitment to action sports culture.\n\n### Questions?\n\nJoin [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/gnars), subscribe to [gnarly.news](https://gnarly.news/), check out [gnars.com](https://gnars.com), or boardslide into our DMs on Twitter [(@gnars_dao)](https://twitter.com/gnars_dao) or Instagram [(@gnarsdao)](https://www.instagram.com/gnarsdao/). \n\nThanks everynoun for taking the time to peruse this funding request.\n\n[Gami](https://twitter.com/0xigami), like origami.\n\n⌐◨-◨",

My primary reason is that gnars should go into much more detail into the following two questions:\n\n1. What did Gnars do with the previous proposal?\n2. What does Gnars *plan* to do with the funding moving forward?\n\nRe: Question 1 —  I know you've done some really awesome things like sponsor the skater that won the championship! and other awesome things which probably resulted in lots of impressions for ⌐◨-◨ — but your prop doesn't go into these details 🥹\n\nMore generally, i sincerely think it's important for nouns to create a culture where proposers provide sufficient context *on-chain*. It is especially important in a community where new members join every single day, so that each new member can make the best possible decision with sufficient context.\n\nTo summarize, I'd prefer to see this back on-chain with more detail and broken up into 2 stages.",

The question, rather, is whether we trust that DAO to be valuable stewards of that money.\n\nI see these types of proposals as \"cultural venture investments\", similar to our \n@nounsbuilder\n funding. Just as a VC does not review all the expenses of their portfolio companies, I'm not sure we need to know how exactly a subDAO is going to spend the money we give them. Rather, we just need to know whether a) we trust that the subDAO will steward those funds in a way that is positive for Nouns DAO, and b) if the cumulative ask is an amount of our treasury we are comfortable \"locking up\" until we see the cultural ROI from that spending.\n\nThe bar is super high for both a) and b), but this proposal meets both of them for me, so I decided to vote yes.",

How much would each event cost? can we know the events and whatnot upfront? \n\n- Personally I don't like the idea of giving people ETH to buy 2 nouns. I had to spend 30+E to get mine, others much more. I could write a proposal saying I'll do x y z marketing give me a free noun, but that would be unfair. Nouns arent a cheap NFT, 30E is like a full years salary for many in the US. \n\n- Gnars has daily auctions which give them ETH, they still have over 70E in their treasury to use (which is great given the 60ish we funded them with in the past). I feel gnars could be self sufficient and this proposal is asking for a large amount simply because it can. \n\n- With 3360 Gnars in circ, giving gnars dao 700E would 10x the book value of a gnar when a noun trades at half.

      "description": "# Creator Contests - a Nounish Funding Middleware\n\n## Tldr\nFund the Calabara team with 60 ETH to continue developing Creator Contests for a 3-month sprint.\n\n## Introduction\nHi NounsDAO, we’re nick and weez, the tandem behind Calabara and Creator Contests. \n\n### Our Nounish Journey: part 1\n\nBoth of us were introduced to Nouns by way of SharkDAO, which we first joined over a year ago. We were fascinated by the Nouns protocol and community and soon began building out sharkish tools to ease some of the unique challenges of a Nounish subDAO. We created a dashboard for SharkDAO, which included widgets for a snapshot client, calendar, and token-gated document center. We wanted to build a simple interface for casual members to be able to quickly catch up on the latest in SharkDAO and Nouns. Soon after, other communities asked if they could have their own dashboards. We open-sourced the code, modularized the components, and invited other web3 groups to join. Today, we’d describe [Calabara](https://calabara.com/explore) as an open-source design house for public infrastructure and applications.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/V819CqQ.png)\n\n\nBy prop [62](https://nouns.wtf/vote/62), we began to get excited about many of the ideas being communicated by the Prop House team. We'd been thinking deeply about community funding protocols for some time ourselves, and were eager to experiment with the Prop House model. Unfortunately, we weren’t yet able to run our own Prop House rounds at SharkDAO (because we don’t use an erc721 for governance). Prop House wasn’t open-source yet, so we decided to fork the core ideas of Prop House and build something of our own: Creator Contests. \n\n## Creator Contests … WTF?\n\nCreator Contests are a nounish middleware for distributing funds to creatives.\n\nCreating scalable funding infrastructure at all levels is a critical building block in establishing Nouns as the world's largest open-source brand. Creator contests build upon the strong foundations developed by the Prop House team while experimenting with novel features to create unique incentive systems and new ways to fund builders – allowing any Nounish community with an ENS the ability to start running their own contests.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nSimilar to Prop House, participants create submissions in response to a contest prompt, and voters choose the best ones. Once the contest is over, funds are distributed to the winners. All contests follow this basic model, but administrators have full control over the contest settings to layer-on additional components. Here’s what we offer today …\n\n* Submitter Rewards\n    * Define 1 or more winning ranks (1st, 2nd, ... nth place)\n    * Define 1 or more rewards for listed ranks (ETH, ERC20, ERC721)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LK2Vg12.png)\n\n* Voter Rewards\n    * Voters that accurately choose rank N submission will split X reward.\n    * Can be used to create unique incentive systems.\n    * NOMO-style games can be created, where voters join forces to try to choose the 2nd best submisison without pushing it to first place.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IBwqCwI.png)\n\n* Participant Restrictions\n    * Token thresholds required for participants to submit or vote\n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/YcwFxhK.png)\n\n* Voting Strategies\n    * Token -- Voting power based on token holdings\n    * Arcade -- Uniform voting power for all qualifying voters\n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/KpVyBT8.png)\n\n* Twitter Integration\n    * Collect submissions via Twitter interactions\n    * Inherit all existing infrastructure while proliferating via Twitter\n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/0J7OkhJ.png)\n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/cDWuZ26.gif)\n    \n* Additional Parameters\n    * Vote total visibility\n    * Anonymous Submissions\n    * Self Voting\n  ![](https://i.imgur.com/jkCGMtY.png)\n\n\n## Our Nounish Journey: part 2\n\nBefore Spring 2022, we had bootstrapped the project ourselves. We were lucky enough to receive support from SharkDAO, and they funded us with 7 ETH to develop an MVP of Creator Contests. We launched our first contest in September, and have helped fund 45 nounish creatives with ~4 ETH and 25k ERC-20 tokens since. 2 months ago, we received a small grant of 8 ETH from NSFW to develop the Twitter Integration mentioned above. We have groups like SharkDAO, Composables, TNS, and the Society of Nounish Cartoonists running contests as we speak. We are now ready to take Creator Contests to the next level.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Fk7grjB.png)\n\n\n## Goals for the funding period\n\nFor this funding period, we’d like to focus on “Top of the funnel” funding infrastructure. This means implementing a scalable protocol for funding creatives in the 0.069 - 3 ETH range. Our goal is to fund 100+ nounish creatives in the 3-month window.\n\nWhile bringing the codebase out of “MVP mode” so it can sufficiently scale to other Nounish pods (and make it easier to fork), we’ll work on the following upgrades:\n\n* Support native video and other media formats\n* Add vote audit reports\n* Add voting capability for Noun delegates\n* Experiment with new voting strategies\n* Simplify contest initialization process.\n* Improve our twitter algorithms\n* UX redesign - It’s time for CC to get Nounish\n\n\nWe’d also like to answer the following questions:\n\n* Are voter rewards a feature or a bug?\n* In the voting period, how impactful are visible vote totals on a communities ability to choose the “best” submissions?\n* Does submission history serve as a relevant talent repository for other pods?\n* Are deep Twitter integrations viable for other tasks, like governance? (Nouncil, Nerman, etc)\n* Are there ways to maintain a certain level of submission quality without directly moderating submissions?\n    * Prop House already sees a certain percentage of “low quality” submissions, and we’ll see higher levels at this funding tier. Are there ways to ensure a certain quality standard without direct moderation? Learnings from this experimentation could be layered on top of Prop House and other applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Defining success\n\nSuccess at the funding tier we are targeting is tightly coupled with onboarding. We’ll define onboarding for the scope of this project as the following:\n\n* New creatives\n    * Introduce new creatives to Nouns and extension communities\n* Existing creatives to larger funding tiers\n    * Support creatives in the earliest stages of ideation that can translate to quality Prop House or NSFW proposals\n* Between Nounish extension communities\n    * Increase the discoverability factor of extension projects and communities through different contest designs and synergies, i.e.\n        * TNS and Composables co-host a round\n        * Multi-community voting\n        * Twitter contests\n\nOf course, success for us also hinders on our ability to proliferate the meme. Twitter integrations drastically increase our proliferation potential -- elevating contests from a siloed web app to a publicly discoverable and interactable experience. We're focused on lifting the stack as close to the \"public edge\" as possible and see the potential for these integrations in other Nounish areas.  \n\nDefining success is one thing, measuring it is different. For this funding term, we’ll do so manually by following up with participants and winners while exploring ways we can automate and better measure this in the future.\n\n\n## Prop House\n\n*Why not just fork Prop House for real?*\n\nWhile we haven’t really heard this much, it’s a valid question that we anticipate some Nouners might have.\n\nHalting further experimentation to go back and layer our changes on top of the PH codebase feels like a step backwards at this point in time. We envision a coordinated approach where both PH and CC are able to sandbox and test different ideas and merge the ones that work. Ultimately, the far more relevant component to fork will be the smart contracts for a trustless implementation that the PH team is leading, which we fully plan on doing. \n\nAt worst, CC is an alternative client for Prop House. At best, it is an experiment in funding infrastructure, working alongside Prop House in developing sound protocols for high velocity, trustless, and scalable funding infrastructure for web3 communities – all powered by Nouns.\n\n## Team\n\nWeez: frontend, designer, UX, support\nNick: lead dev, fullstack\n\n## Links\n* [Calabara](https://calabara.com/explore)\n* [Github](https://github.com/calabara-hq/calabara)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/calabarahq)\n\n## Budget\n\n60 ETH for continued development\n\n3/5 Multisig tasked with sending 30 ETH of project funds to the team wallet upon execution, and setting up a 3-month stream for the remaining funds.\n\nSigners:\n\nNick: nickdodson.eth\nBenbodhi: signed.benbodhi.eth\nJuan: juanx.eth\nJoshuaFisher: joshuafisher.eth\nToadyHawk: toadyhawk.eth\n\n\n## Proposed Transactions\n\n0x55d1f4091Ced357cD4C4F9dd12531b8fDBe2dd26.transfer(\n    60.0 ETH\n)",

      "description": "# Nouns CC0 Animation Generator & Interactive App\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iFxuOIn.gif)![](https://i.imgur.com/KG0Tk59.gif)![](https://i.imgur.com/TZkJ9bL.gif)\n\n## TL;DR\n\nWe’re aiming to bring Nouns to life by animating all Nouns assets as public goods for cc0 use. We'll build tools for users to generate & access their own animations quickly and easily for use in any project. There's 20 unique and thoughtfully crafted animations to choose from with over 467,000,000 possible animation outcomes.\n\n* Through a front-end app, anyone can enter a Noun ID or mix and match traits to create their own custom Noun and export animations on the spot.\n* Developers will be able to programmatically access any of these animations instantly and seamlessly through an API and/or a URL.\n* Interact with your Noun (including custom ones) through an interactive app on a daily basis with actions like eating, sleeping, playing, and more! The status of each Noun will change throughout the day and you can tend to it accordingly to keep it alive, happy, and healthy.\n\n## Introduction & Background\n---\nHello Everyone,\n\nI'm Jeff (aka heyjeff.eth, jefe) and I’ve been developing an app over the past year that aims to engage NFT collectors by bringing their NFTs to life. Quick backstory:\n\nThe concept was inspired by the popular Japanese phenomenon ‘Tamagotchi’ released in the late 90’s. Each handheld device contains a virtual friend the user must tend to in order to keep it alive, happy, and healthy. Interestingly enough, it’s a style of game that you don’t necessarily ‘beat’ or ‘win’. It’s more of an experience of having a buddy that you can play with, care for, and watch grow throughout it’s lifespan, forever.\n\nI thought it’d be fun if people could do the same with their NFTs, so I decided to build a prototype. At first it started out as just a silly napkin sketch, but now we’re proud to say we’ve recently finished adding support for all 6,969 CrypToadz, each with 11 unique animations totaling over 75,000 files! *(That’s 7.6 GB of raw toad data)*. For those who own a CrypToad, you can check out the app [here](https://tinycitizen.xyz).\n\nHere’s some footage:\n[![CrypToadz Gameplay](https://i.imgur.com/KHs4MZi.png)](https://vimeo.com/780511900)\n\n\n## Motivation and Goals\n---\nWhat we’re aiming to do is leverage the tech we’ve developed for CrypToadz and adapt it to build tools so that anyone can generate, access, and download Nounish animations on demand for cc0 use.\n\nTo do this, we’ll develop an easy-to-use Build-a-Noun app through which anyone can choose a pre-existing Noun or build their own by mixing and matching traits at will or at random. Users will be able to preview animations on the fly and then instantly download any or all of the animations they like, with the option of exporting the individual animation frames as well. The app is future-proofed too, so every Noun that is born each day will be readily accessible.\n\nNot only that, but any animation for any Noun configuration can be easily accessible via a back-end API and/or a URL for developers to use in their web apps instantly and seamlessly.\n\nAs an added bonus, anyone can immediately interact and play with their Noun or custom Noun through our other interactive app we’ve already built!\n\nUltimately, the goal of all of this is to empower people to actively use Nouns in engaging, refreshing, and easy ways to help spread the meme.\n\n## Build-A-Noun App, prototype & poc\n(early prototype shown, does not represent final product)\n[![Build-A-Noun Prototype](https://i.imgur.com/Viv5UfU.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/777492078)\n\nThe 20 total actions and states are: idle (breathing/blinking), happy/loved, laughing, talking, dancing/head bob, eating: pizza, mushroom, veggies, fruit, hamburger, playing a gameboy, sad/crying, drinking: coffee, water, tea, health/mana potion, tired, sick, and sleeping.\n\nThe above is an early prototype solely to convey the concept of the Build-A-Noun app. The final product will have a redesigned and intuitive interface, with way more options and functionality, such as:\n* Select transparent or any background color (hex or rbg input)\n* Quick select any existing Noun ID config\n* Searchable traits by ID or name\n* Randomize traits button\n* Flip the animation (left-facing vs right-facing)\n* Change output animation speed\n* Apply an rbg tint to the animation\n* Apply a black and white filter to the animation\n* Resize animation to specific dimensions\n* Export all individual frames for a given animation\n* Pick and choose which animations to export\n* Add text overlays\n* Share-to-Twitter button to quickly tweet your creations \n\nFlipped![](https://i.imgur.com/bIxYeRQ.gif) B/w filter![](https://i.imgur.com/eI9okhg.gif)\nrbg(255, 5, 555) tint![](https://i.imgur.com/1n2f2xY.gif) Sped up 3x![](https://i.imgur.com/FsMU13t.gif) Flipped, 0.75x speed, rbg(293, 65, 5) tint![](https://i.imgur.com/AaLiqTR.gif)\n\n\n*Examples of animation customization options*\n\nIn total, we’d pre-generate 8,700 animation files (435 Nouns assets x 20 unique states), each with an average of 30 frames per animation. That's  a total of 261,000 individual frames to bring this vision to life! There are 23,377,200 possible combinations for a Noun, and 467,544,00 possible animations outcomes (23,377,200 x 20)!\n\n\n## Why?\n---\nCurrently, there isn't a scalable tool in the Nouniverse that allows users to quickly produce a wide range of highly customizable Nounish cc0 animations on demand.\n\nGame developers, content creators, and everyday users can benefit from such a tool as a building block to create even bigger and more Nounish things!\n\nWe're trying to fill this gap in the Nounscape by providing STOMMs (*Super Tool of Mass-Memeification*) in an area that is lacking. With this tool in place, I believe we'll see an explosion of new Nounish content for everyone to use and enjoy as they see fit.\n\nPlus, being able to interact with your Noun deepens our emotional connection to them!\n\n## Sneak Peeks\n---\nWe made the following animations for Lil Nouns for fun as a test, but the same concepts apply for Nouns. Here's a peek at 10 out of the 20 total states. Choose any background color you like, or none at all (transparent).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/u0ZdEUw.gif)\nIdle\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/p9ecpWa.gif)\nEating pizza\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ygk8hBI.gif)\nSleeping\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/euvT8qO.gif)\nPlaying Gameboy\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CqHr6cL.gif)\nHappy\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Wnxg4Uj.gif)\nSad/Crying\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1TBwth1.gif)\nDrinking coffee\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LmXiVcz.gif)\nSick\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qbxc4Wy.gif)\nTired\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oIWI1F3.gif)\nHealth potion\n\n## Interactive App ~ Bonus ~\n---\nAnyone who owns a Noun or builds one with our Noun Builder app can interact with it on a daily basis through an app we've already built (works on mobile too)! Each Noun will be animated to reflect it's current state or action - it will truly feel like your Noun has come to life!\n\nHere are the following mechanics:\n\n4 Stats (each max val of 100):\n* Fullness\n* Energy\n* Happiness\n* Health\n\n3 Player Actions (each grants XP needed in order to level up):\n* Feeding – Increases fullness and happiness\n* Sleeping – Increases energy and health\n* Playing – Increases happiness, decreases fullness and energy\n\n3 Conditions:\n* Can’t sleep while starving\n* Can’t play while sleep-deprived\n* Can’t eat while sick\n\n3 Items (purchasable with points earned from completing actions)\n* Coffee – Triples the amount of XP gained, but cannot sleep for 8 hr\n* Health Potion – Replenishes health to full\n* Mushroom (can be easily reskinned to another object) – 1 of 4 potential effects, chosen at random:\n    * Jumbles stats at random\n    * Earn a random amount of XP\n    * Gain 1 level\n    * Eat a poisonous mushroom and die\n* All stats decay by 2 every 4 hours automatically, forever\n* Sometimes, at random, 1 of the 4 stats will be depleted to zero if all stats are non-zero\n* If neglected for ~8 days, the NFT will die\n* NFTs can be revived, but lose 1 level and costs points\n* Highest levels are ranked in a public leaderboard\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PaRnHTs.gif)\n*Nounish interactive gameplay demo (limited features)*\n\n\n## How is this valuable to Nouns??\n---\n\n### 1. Public Goods & Network Effects\n\nEveryone from experienced devs to everyday users will be able to generate & access Nounish animations on demand, either through the API or the front-end tool within a few clicks.\n\nThis means anyone -- enthusiasts, developers, and/or content creators can save countless hours by bootstrapping these animations to be used any way they like! Some examples include: \n\n* Enrich existing apps or websites\n* Use as stickers and/or emojis for Discord servers\n* Use the animations to develop a game\n* Use them to make merch and/or NFTs\n* Enhance Nounish media like tweets, infographics, or videos\n* Use as pfps\n* Download the individual animation frames to make sprite sheets\n* Use the frame data to create lip-synced animated avatars for video/audio calls\n\n-- the possibilities are endless!\n\nThe end result will lead to quicker turnarounds for prototypes and media creations, and act as a catalyst for the proliferation of new Nounish content overall.\n\nQuote from devcarrot, Nounder:\n\"This sounds like a very fun idea, I love the animations. Would you be willing to make the data accessible to other developers via a public API? Maybe with something like a license that requires attribution? It could be interesting to have Nounish characters hanging out on the various projects’ sites; imagine Timpers’ disco floor but with TinyCitizen characters rendered in real time.\n\nThe disco floor:\n![](https://cdck-file-uploads-europe1.s3.dualstack.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/a/a30c42ece4e30f7f4aac00f6979b82a057b19eb9.gif)\"\n\n\n### 2. Rally community around organic and fun reward systems\n\nThrough the interactive app we’ve already built, it provides opportunities for users to earn rewards through quests.\n\nAs an example, we’ve successfully rewarded 80+ unique CrypToadz players with a CrypToadz hat and pair of Nouns glasses to those who reached level 10 with a CrypToad through the interactive app. Everyone shared how much they loved this event!\n\nThis provides a more rewarding experience because the merch drop felt earned rather than simply given. In turn, it promotes camaraderie and a sense of fellowship among the community who want to achieve a mutual desired result by partaking in shared experiences.\n\nAny Nounish DAO that wishes to engage their audience can task their community with completing certain actions through the app and granting them an award upon completion.\n\n**Reward bundle: CrypToadz Hat + Noun Glasses + NFT NYC Coaster**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Xupiot6.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f8PToWz.jpg)\n\n*pssst… This event is still ongoing! If you want a CrypToadz hat and Nouns glasses you can still grind for them! Find me on Discord :wink:*\n\n### 3. Tap into & activate new creators and builders\nIf we make these assets readily available for people to access in an engaging and easy manner, it could open up doors for new people to enter the ecosystem.\n\nThose that need assets to build on Nouns in new or interesting ways but have no developer or animation experience can often feel discouraged not knowing where to start.\n\nWith the Build-A-Noun app as a building block, we can inspire existing Nounish community members as well as potential new ones to create something Nounish easily and quickly. Anyone can get up and running with tens, hundreds, or thousands of animations ready to use within minutes.\n\n\n## Deliverables\n---\n* Create an easy-to-use front-end tool + website where anyone can create and download unique cc0 gifs for any Noun configuration on the spot. The 20 unique states/actions are:\n    * Idle (breathing + blinking)\n    * Happy/Loved\n    * Sad/Crying\n    * Laughing\n    * Talking\n    * Sleeping\n    * Dancing/Head bob\n    * Eating\n        * pizza\n        * mushroom\n        * fruit\n        * veggies\n        * hamburger\n    * Drinking\n        * coffee\n        * water\n        * tea\n        * health potion\n        * mana potion\n    * Playing a gameboy\n    * Tired\n    * Sick\n* Create a back-end API, where anyone can instantly grab any animation for any Noun configuration for use in their web apps programmatically via an API key and/or a URL\n* Revamped front-end design with mobile-friendly version to generate animations on the go!\n* Integration with our existing free-to-play side-app where users can interact and play with their Nouns (already built)\n* Publicly host the raw base64 encoded png frame data for all Nouns assets in json format so anyone can use the animation frames how they like\n\n## Timeline\n---\n### Total: 10 weeks\n\nEach individual trait needs to be manually animated for all 20 states. That's roughly ~1,000 files per week (435 x 20 / 8). Some take shorter than others because they're static in a given animation, or they mimic the same motion as another animation and can be ported. Regardless, there is a lot of upfront work to be done.\n\n### Weeks 1-4:\nFront-end work, complete site redesign and development. Mobile-friendly optimization. Developing gif creation software with various customization options.\n\n~50% of animations files complete\n\n### Weeks 5-8:\nBack-end work on API creation. Work on image processing and manipulating animation frame data. Create hosting solution for animation data.\n\n~100% of animation files complete\n\n### Weeks 9 & 10:\nHook-up back-end to front-end. Allow 2 week buffer for testing & bug fixes, or any last minute optimizations/improvements.\n\n## Who we are\n---\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EkzLRN9.gif)**heyjeff.eth** - Full-Stack Dev / Design / Vision / Logistics\n\nI’m an engineer, problem-solver, and purveyor of ideas that I believe are worth telling.\n\nI've been involved in the NFT space since early 2021 and became Noun-pilled a couple months ago through some people I’ve met within the CrypToadz community. Since becoming a recent Nouncillor, most of the free time I have is spent in Nounish discords meeting cool new people, discussing ideas, and learning as much as I can about all things Nouns!\n\nSome of my credentials include:\n* 6+ years as a professional engineer/designer\n* 3 separate CrypToadz proposals funded\n    * 185 total “for” votes, 0 total “against” votes across the 3 props\n    *    Total of 21E funded (most funded individual from within the CrypToadz community)\n    *    All proposal deliverables fulfilled\n*    1 CrypToadz Prop house round funded\n* Created a hosting solution to make 75,000+ unique CrypToadz cc0 animations publicly available via URLs\n    * As an example, [here's](https://cryptopetz.s3.amazonaws.com/game-files/0x1CB1A5e65610AEFF2551A50f76a87a7d3fB649C6/5500/5500.gif) CrypToad ID #5500 in it's idle state. To see any toad in action, replace '5500' in the URL with the desired ID!\n    *pssst.... try appending an action to the trailing ID, i.e., 5500-pizza.gif*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SaBqVim.gif)![](https://i.imgur.com/y5TVXAK.gif)![](https://i.imgur.com/J19sE2F.gif)![](https://i.imgur.com/QR05Zb7.gif)![](https://i.imgur.com/ReV5Ffs.gif)\n\n---\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7XnfUOt.gif)**PixelFowl** - Pixel Artist / Python Dev / Power Metal Enthusiast / Former Chicken Parent\n\n\"Hi! I’m Pixelfowl, also known as Johannfowl. I’m a Brazilian pixel artist and animator that loves coffee, power metal and writing short stories. I used to be a freelance copywriter, but I always loved art and indie games. So, in the first opportunity I had, I tried pixel art — that hooked me instantly.\n\nDuring this past year I had the amazing opportunity of working with Jeff and it really changed the game for me. After learning a lot, creating hundreds of animations and writing thousands of lines of code, we’re making things that we thought were impossible, and now we’re going even further!\"\n\nPixelFowl's credentials:\n* Lead pixel artist behind 75,000+ CrypToadz animations\n* Made all animations available for cc0 use\n* Developed core python script to automate the generation of CrypToadz animations\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HmfnOFp.gif)![](https://i.imgur.com/DJTXuta.gif)![](https://i.imgur.com/PWe54Lk.gif)![](https://i.imgur.com/vQQtZ2Z.gif)![](https://i.imgur.com/9wYtQxC.gif)\n\n## Current Success Metrics (as of Oct '22)\n---\nAs for our interactive app, CrypToadz holders seem to really enjoy it. Here’s a few metrics that show it’s stickiness. Note that no capital or time has been spent on marketing or advertising up to this point.\n\nRetention Rates:\nDay 1 Retention: 25% (Industry average)\nDay 7 Retention: 15% (Industry average)\nDay 30 Retention: 9% (Above industry average)\n\nActive Users:\nDaily Active Users / Monthly Active Users = 28% (Above industry average)\n\n\n## Proposed Funding\n---\n55E for **Deliverables** within **Timeline** (10 weeks)\n(immediately converted to USDC to avoid volatility)\n\n*    60% Development of front-end Build-A-Noun app + back-end API tool\n      * Complete website redesign/development & deployments\n      * Mobile-friendly optimizations\n      * Gif creation software development with various customization options\n      * API endpoint creation\n      * Software development for image processing/manipulation\n      * Create hosting solution for animation frame data\n      * Hooking up back-end to front-end, testing & bug fixes\n\n*    40% Asset generation\n     * Animating all 435 assets each in 20 states\n     * Script development on animation automation and converting animations to workable json data\n\nAt the proposed cost, it works out to around <$8 per animation file, and $.00015 (not a typo, 1/100th of 1 penny) per possible animation using this tool.\n\n## Testimonials\n---\nA lot of people have mentioned how much they loved their toad animations and seeing them in action, some even buying their first toad because of the interactive app! I think it’d be fun to provide this same experience for the Nouns community.\n\n*\"This sounds like a very fun idea, I love the animations.\"*\n-devcarrot, Nounder\n\n*“Big fan of Toadzgotchi personally; Love what you're building.”*\n-HEEEEEEEEEEE, CrypToadz founding team\n\n*“Excited for lore and Toadzgotchi as well.”*\n-Gremplin, pixel placer extraordinaire, artist for CrypToadz and Nouns\n\n*“I love my animated toad!

THANK YOU!\n\n## Future\n\nIn the future, we'd like to add more animations and more Nounish subcommunities (Lils, Gnars, etc), plus explore the idea of letting anyone upload their own animations to the builder in a review style process. This way, we can accrue an expansive database of assets to be used by all as the go-to solution for Nounish animations!\n\n## Thank You\n\nI sincerely appreciate everyone who spent time reading this. I am excited and eager to help contribute to the future of Nounish animations together!

Conveying a good idea in a way that voters can understand and relate to is even more difficult.  With the increased number of proposals and ideas coming in weekly, it’s more important than ever to effectively communicate one's idea and value proposition.  For some builders, proposal writing may not be a core strength. So their proposals may fail on-chain, even if the core concept is valuable.\n    \n2. **Effective Communication with DAO Voters is Difficult**\n    \n    One of the most difficult challenges for builders in the Nouns ecosystem has always been figuring out how to have open dialog with voting Nouners and Delegates. These challenges will only increase as the DAO grows. Now, with the Official Nouns Discord closed, this is an even more pressing issue. \n    \n3. **Constructive and Honest Feedback is Rare**\n    \n    Very few people within Nouns are giving truly honest and constructive criticism to proposals that need work. Discourse and Nouncil feedback sometimes can be “soft”, as people may not want to publicly discuss the potential pitfalls of a fellow community member’s idea or hurt their feelings.  We see this occurring more frequently with on-chain proposals, and it doesn’t help anyone in the long run.\n\n\n\n[![boxbrain.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/14xN6w0Y/boxbrain.gif)](https://postimg.cc/wRVvYtGh)*Think INSIDE the box!*\n\n\n# Our Solutions\n\n**PropBox will aim to solve the above pain points in the following ways:**\n\n1. Ugly Dao has a talented roster of builders, many of whom have experience writing successful proposals for Prop House, NSFW and on-chain. We also have professionals with experience in the legal, marketing, education, and communications fields. With our combined training and experience, we can help builders create proposals that make an impact. Additionally, sometimes the most difficult part of seeking funding from Nouns is **knowing where to go.** We can help proposers understand if their idea is best suited to a Prop House round, an NSFW pitch, a discussion with the newly minted DCS Pod, or a full on-chain proposal. Finally, we believe that proposals should lean on multimedia content to achieve maximum impact in an attention-scarce environment. We want to help builders integrate engaging videos and visuals into their proposals.\n\n2. We know the Nouns community like the back of our Ugly hand, and can help new builders navigate the difficult task of amplifying the message of their proposal. From appearances on The Noun Square, discussions in Nouncil or other Nounish discords, as well as conversations on Twitter, Discourse, House of Nouns and elsewhere, we know how to help builders with the most difficult part of getting funded for a proposal: **Communicating directly with the people who ultimately will vote yes or no.** \n\n3. The DAO needs more well-intentioned people who are not afraid to give would-be builders The Ugly Truth, and we are prepared to do so.\n\n\n# The PropBox Value Prop\n\nOur goal is to become the premier resource to help builders create great proposals and find pathways to funding in the Nouns ecosystem. We plan to find and incubate teams and projects from multiple sources, including:\n\n- Current builders in the ecosystem who are looking for feedback and help navigating the proposal process.\n- New builders who need extra help onboarding into Nouns, writing proposals, and making the right connections to be successful.\n- “Uncut gems” from Prop House and Discourse to fund proof of concept projects and prepare the teams for potential larger on-chain proposals in the future. We aim to find builders with the highest potential and help them fulfill that potential. Ideas from this category should have at least 10x potential from the amount of initial funding.\n\n# The Origin Story\n\nThis project began as an initiative by [Andrew ](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/andrewladdusaw.eth)[Laddusaw](https://twitter.com/AndrewLaddusaw), through [Nouncil](https://discord.gg/nouncil), following the [Combinator Round in Prop House](https://prop.house/nouns/open-round:-25-eth) back in July (aka “the before times.”) Andrew saw a lot of talented teams that submitted great proposals, but of course the round only had one winner for the 25ETH prize. \n\nHe began contacting builders and building a system within Nouncil Discord to give these teams feedback to prepare them for an on-chain proposal, or to help them secure alternative funding sources. When they began reviewing proposals publicly as a group, other builders asked for help as well.\n\nDuring this initial trial, the Incubator team gave feedback to 9 proposals. Through that process: One secured funding through NSFW. One pursued another Prop House to fund a proof of concept, won, and later joined Nouncil. One ended up abandoning the initial idea, but moved on to other projects during the incubation process, and has now been funded for multiple other projects within the DAO (shout out [ripe0x](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/ripe0x.eth).) Two other proposals ended up with on-chain votes, one narrowly being defeated and one securing funding for 40 ETH (Prop 144 for One Click Bots). \n\n[![andre-testimonial.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/JnndSt6P/andre-testimonial.gif)](https://vimeo.com/774010662/b852cb4533)\n*Click to watch a 2 minute PropBox testimonial video from Andrei (BotFrens)*\n\nWe learned a lot through this experiment. We’re continuing to follow up with the builders as they hone their ideas, and expect to see even more fruit from these efforts in the coming months. We’re also continuing to improve our feedback process and we believe we’re ready for the next phase of growth.\n\n\n# The Timeline\n\n**This proposal will support the PropBox team for a 3 month period to do the following:**\n\n- Actively locate builders in the ecosystem to help drive their ideas forward and guide them through the proposal process that is most appropriate to their ideas and building stage.\n- Create an active Builder’s Guild in the PropBox Discord, where those who are creating tools and proposals can do so in the open, and together. This well help create consistent startup energy in the Nouns community.\n- Review every Discourse, and various Discord community posts, making sure everyone submitting proposal ideas gets quality feedback and the best possible Nouns experience when they first arrive in the community. One of our greatest desires is that new, talented builders would not leave the community discouraged after getting negative feedback, simply because they didn’t understand the funding process or the culture of what it means to be a part of Nouns.\n- Create a website to house a toolkit of templates, best practices, tips and tricks, and contact information giving builders a toolbox to maximize success.\n- We will also spend the next three months exploring several ideas, which we will present to the community at the end of the proposal funding period:\n    - *How to potentially make an incubator like this self-sustaining in the future.*\n    - *A system to temperature check proposals and gather feedback from as many sources as possible, including from those with the most likelihood to swing vote outcomes.*\n    - *How to create efficiencies in the proposal process, so that new community members can transition from their first interactions to building as effectively as possible within the DAO.*\n    - *Exploring systems of trust-building to make sure that scammers are not able to abuse the treasury through gaming or fraud.*\n    - *Decisions about what form this group should take in the future; how to incorporate new members, ideas, and processes to maintain the highest degree of quality feedback, help, and value to the DAO.*\n\n\nAll of the above is to serve the ultimate goals of PropBox: \n\n**To help builders write high quality proposals, and to make decision-making simpler and less time-consuming for DAO members.**\n\n# The Budget\n\n**75ETH** **Total**\n\n- **60 ETH** - In our trial, we were able to achieve a great deal of success with people who were just volunteering their time. We know that with DAO funding, we will have much more capacity to onboard talented builders and incubate many more proposals. \n    - **20 ETH** per month as a payment to team members, to be paid retroactively based on work completed and builders helped. This work will include engaging builders at every stage of the proposal process, guiding them, and helping to write effective and media-rich proposals. These team rewards will be distributed via biweekly Coordinape rounds (Nouncil model.) All payment data will be publicly available to the DAO. \n    - Our team goal will be to engage with a minimum of 30 builders about their proposals over the course of a 3 month period. \n    \n- **10 ETH** for a pool to fund some small projects, as an experiment in additional targeted flexible funding for the DAO: Taking small ideas that we encounter through the process of our work and helping those teams to execute small ideas or create MVPs of larger ones. \n- **5 ETH** of retro funding for what has been done to build this system already.\n\n# The PropBox Team\n\nWe are a group of Nounish builders that have created and executed successful proposals at every funding level. We are consistently active in Discourse, offering constructive feedback and working privately with builders to help them formulate effective proposals and seek funding. We are passionate about great ideas, effective communication, and robust proposals that drive the nounish meme forward. ⌐◨-◨\n\n[![propbox-group-shot-smaller.png](https://i.postimg.cc/qvQ8CwwZ/propbox-group-shot-smaller.png)](https://postimg.cc/ZWB9Gr1r)\n\n- ***Lead: [Andrew Laddusaw](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/andrewladdusaw.eth)***\n- ***Core Team:***\n***[BradQ](https://twitter.com/iambradq)***\n***[ProfWerder](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/profwerder.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8)***\n***[SuperTightWoody](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/supertight.eth)***\n***[Toady Hawk](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/toadyhawk.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8)***\n\n***Support: Other UglyDAO Members***\n*18 super builders and counting with diverse skills and talents who are passionate ambassadors for Nouns inside and outside of the community*\n\n**Multisig:**\n*Funds will be transferred to and held in a 3/5 Gnosis Safe (propboxvault.eth) with the 5 trusted Nouns community members above.*\n\n# The Bottom Line\n\nWe believe the DAO needs to attract more awesome builders, and needs teams of diligent people finding good ideas and helping them to bloom into full-fledged, effective Nounish initatives. \n\nWe are uniquely qualified to help these builders write awesome proposals, strategize ideal funding paths, and facilitate DAO communications, and we are asking for a mandate to do exactly that. \n\n## Think INSIDE the Box, vote YES for Prop 175!

Information repositories already exist in the form of Nouns Center, which is already linked to from the main Nouns website.\n\n- Unclear outcomes or measurements of success\nHow is success being measured here?

This way, it is much easier to measure success while also allowing the team to find/consult with builders.\n\n9999:\nThe team is passionate and well placed to execute on this idea. I think it’s reasonable to get funds to test out a consultancy/incubator on a small scale, but I dislike subsidizing this entirely for 3 months when there’s an obvious business model. \nIn general, I am for the consultancy model and believe it can bring qualified builders to the DAO. To that end, the market has the ability to signal whether the PropBox idea/team/approach works and funding to the extent requested would distort this process.\nIn addition to reducing the timeline and funding amount, I would recommend voting for this proposal if it had target metrics: 1 month, interface with 10-15 builders, target 1-2 amazing on-chain proposal, include a “finders fee” to subsidize the funding gap.\n\ndevcarrot:\nI agree with the other Nounders that there should be a market for this type of advising that takes the form of a \"finders fee\" or \"tip\". I would like to see this proposal changed to either include more discrete objectives or, as Aubtoshi mentioned, expanded to be a source of earlier funding.

      "description": "# Nouns x MrBeast\n\nA proposal drafted by [**Hindsight**](https://twitter.com/0Hindsight) (ProNouns: NFT/OG) with the support of [**Jarmen**](https://twitter.com/jarmen43) (a man struggling to tell his wife he is a zebra on the internet) and [**Sam Ellis**](https://twitter.com/manofmissle) (Chief Meme Officer)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Dz7SOwt.jpg)\n\n&nbsp;\n## **HOW TO VOTE ON THIS PROPOSAL**\n\n* **Vote Yes:** If you think it would be good value for DAO to pay 500 Eth to have a Nounish focused episode on the most watched show on the internet - with a money back guarantee if it doesn’t happen. \n* **Vote No:** If you don’t think that would be good value.\n* **Abstain:** If you gift people toasters for their wedding.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## **THE CHALLENGE**\nThis proposal requests that the DAO fund a project for **500 eth** in order to proliferate the Nouns by running **a competition, open to anyone, to** **convince** [**Mr. Beast**](https://www.youtube.com/user/mrbeast6000) **to give away $500k (340 Eth)**, preferably to charity, on his YouTube channel, given to him by the Nouns in a Nounish focused episode of his show.\n\n**The person or people that convince Mr. Beast to do this will be rewarded with a $250k prize.**\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## **THE REWARD**\nThe $250k Reward will be awarded to the person or people that Mr. Beast credits with convincing him to accept the challenge on the following terms:\n\n*   $175k if he accepts the request and does the show.\n*   An additional $75k if he gives the majority (>50%) of the $500k to charity. (This can be the same person and message or different people and messages)\n*   The episode must be on Mr. Beasts main YouTube channel.\n*   The Nouns must be featured on the show for any of the funds to be paid out.\n\nSo it might be a good idea for people to submit ideas to Mr. Beast that inspires him to meet these criteria. \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## **TOTAL COST**\nIf this proposal passes but no one can convince Mr. Beast to take on and complete the project within the next 9 months – all the Eth will be returned to the Treasury. **Total Cost of 0 Eth.**\n\nIf this proposal passes and someone is successful in convincing Mr. Beast to feature the Nouns in the most watched show on the internet while hopefully giving a lot of money away to good causes it will have a **Total Cost of 500 Eth.**\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## **WHY MR. BEAST?**\nHe is the most watched person on the internet (with over 100m subscribers and up to 300m views on his videos), so I think Nouns featuring on his show would bring awareness to Nouns, NFTs, DAOs and Ethereum to millions. In doing so, it will allow people to see the great creative initiatives that Nouns are working on and have funded (e.g.[73](https://nouns.wtf/vote/73))  as well as charities it has supported (e.g. [104](https://nouns.wtf/vote/104) ,[42](https://nouns.wtf/vote/42) ). On top of this I would hope it will showcase the ability of a decentralised network of people to raise funds and successfully deploy those funds in innovative ways that leverages its community to make big things happen!\n\nMr. Beast already has a good awareness of crypto and he has a history of giving to charity at a large scale too so hopefully he will be able to bring awareness to all of this in a thoughtful, considered, and fun way.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## **A $250k REWARD … THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY!?**\nI can imagine some Nouners balking at the $250k prize being paid to whoever can convince Mr. Beast to take on this challenge, which is understandable.\n\nMy goal is to create value for the DAO and while one could argue that people will take on this challenge for a smaller amount – we just don’t know if it would be _as_ effective and ultimately it will always be a guess as to what the _right_ figure is.\n\nThe goal is to mobilise 99.9% of the internet and get them interested in making this happen through the incentive of a big reward. And while no one can be certain of the exact figure that would be most effective, what I _do_ know is that $250k has a high chance of success. It will advertise itself by getting people talking about it and it will massively increase the chances of the challenge being accepted. I believe we would rather potentially pay more to increase the chances of success.\n\nWhile it is a lot of money, I think it presents extremely good value. Price is what you pay and value is what you get. If no one can make it happen, nothing gets paid out and the price is zero. But if someone does make it happen, a $750k price to have the Nouns featured on the most watched show on the internet will provide great value.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## **WHAT DO I GET FROM THIS?**\nNothing\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Terms and Conditions**\n*   Transfer will be made to the prize winner after the video has aired on YouTube.\n*   Mr. Beast cannot refer himself as the person to win the prize.\n*   If Mr. Beast decides to do the show but does not (or can not) identify the person or message that convinced him to take it on - the $250k will be put into a prop house round where $50k will be awarded to 5 charities as voted on by Nouners.\n*   The $500k (340 Eth) will be transferred from the multisig to Mr. Beast upon written agreement between the parties.\n*   For the interest of transparency and to avoid conflicts of interest: I am not Mr. Beast nor do I have any affiliation with him in any way. If (somehow) it is me or this proposal that convinces him to do the challenge or to do it for charity, I will pledge the prize fund to charity and no Nounder will be eligible to win this prize.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Funds**\nIf the proposal passes, Eth to the equivalent of $750k will be converted to USDC to fund the challenge and any excess will be returned to the treasury. \n\nThe funds will remain in the multisig until either the challenge is accepted or converted back to Eth and returned to the treasury after 9 months if the challenge is not accepted.\n\nThe funds will be held in a 2 / 3 Multisig with the signatures being:\n\n*   Hindsight - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0Hindsight) - [Agora](https://www.nounsagora.com/delegate/0xhindsight.eth)\n*   Jarmen - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jarmen43)\n*   Sam Ellis - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/manofmissle) - [Agora](https://www.nounsagora.com/delegate/thepencil.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8)",

I think the layout is a bit too vague on guidelines for the public + how we will get this message outside of the Nouns bubble (i.e. Aubtoshi would be a fantastic face for this on socials for announcing it etc.).  This IS a fantastic idea and has sparked some amazing conversations in Nouncil and Twitter Space rooms within the community.  \n\nMy main worry is: \n1) We have no control over what people will do for $250k.  I see a ton of wonderful things happening here but also see how the 1% of people could really hurt the reputation of Nouns IRL via some dumb ploy to get Mr. Beast's attention.  Again, love the concept, maybe we can lay this out with some stricter guides.\n\n2) I would double the 500 to giveaway/make a video.  Mr. Beast is getting so much money right now and we are technically an NFT collection (no matter how much good we do or how much we think he would love Nouns, which I THINK he would).\n\nThis all being said, I thank you all for taking the time to think of this cool concept and would love to see another iteration of this!

Seeking to catch fresh eyes and celebrate the strides made so far, the future potential and why it’s such an exciting time to get involved in the Nouns project.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CEhktTX.gif)\n\n## Who is NeverSitStill?\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/wz4HFXO.png)](https://vimeo.com/675295630)\n\n[Homepage](https://neversitstill.com/) | [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/neversitstill.tv/) | [Behance](https://www.behance.net/NeverSitStill)\n\nNever Sit Still is highly experienced in creating premium brand films, often focused on abstract or hard-to-explain concepts. We have collaborated with many high caliber clients in and out of web3 such as:\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/7kdbuvP.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/586628568)\n\n\n[Compound](https://www.behance.net/gallery/129713109/Compound-III) - Compound III is a collateralised borrowing protocol that optimizes capital efficiency, gas costs, and security.\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/ugBEZmu.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/715516917)\n\n[STL](https://www.behance.net/gallery/146273121/Smart-Token-Labs-TokenScript) - A revolutionary new Web3 technology designed to take Token Gating to the next level.\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/mjRPzlF.png)](https://vimeo.com/553216699)\n\n\n[Coinbase](https://www.behance.net/gallery/131256363/Coinbase) - Coinbase is the easiest place to buy and sell cryptocurrency, via a trusted and easy-to-use platform for accessing the broader crypto economy.\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/yeJCvDP.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/575631888)\n\n[Adobe Splash Screen](https://www.behance.net/gallery/129640141/Adobe-After-Effects) - Each year, Adobe commissions artists from a variety of disciplines and styles to show off the power of Creative Cloud by producing custom artwork to represent each product.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/auygyYd.png)\n\nWe at NeverSitStill encourage creative thinking  and personal development amongst the company,  which lead to a conversation about Nouns with motion designer [James Vallance (MrSEAKs)](https://twitter.com/SeaksMr). His collaboration earlier this year with Gnars DAO, and his work with Gami (Noun 189), to create an animated piece for NFT NYC proliferating Nouns. A major component of Nouns' participation in NFT NYC.\n\nSee more here: [Full video](https://create.zora.co/collections/0xdcbca59d38eb3abfcb5055fe7bd7f5ce027d03c3) | [Artist BTS & NY billboard footage](https://twitter.com/SeaksMr/status/1553862678795661312)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8ja4qFe.png)\n\n## Proposal\n\n### What will we make for you?\n\nA 30-60 second, crafted hype video that represents Nouns in an exciting way. Exploring Nounish themes through visual metaphor, celebrating the culture with existing users, and onboarding the new.\n\nThink of it as an above-the-funnel video encapsulating the key themes of Nouns in a punchy, artistic, and fresh video to make people go WTF is Nouns?\n\nThe look and tone of the piece will be designed to capture attention, potentially becoming an ownable style for future Nouns advertising and messaging material. \n\nIt's a catalyst video to start the gravitational pull that is Nouns.\n\n### What is the video going to be about?\n\nThe video will represent strong themes that Nouns focuses on through visual metaphor:\n\n- Use case of NFTs for raising funds for positive change\n- Evolution and growth of Nouns\n- DAOs/community\n- Bootstrapping/launchpad\n- Interaction of Nouns and IRL, bringing the power of crypto to IRL\n\nWith these ideas at the core, we spin them into a powerful narrative that follows the birth of the Noggles and its exponential growth to become an object of power, one for positive change in the world.\n\nTo represent the multi-faceted nature of the Nouniverse, we intend to use a mixed-media approach, with input from various artists within our team. Distinct flavours coming together to create one visual style in a seamless video.\n\nWe feel this approach also carries the spirit of the Nouns DAO. A diverse pool of people building something great together.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/A0oZVgy.jpg)\n\n### The Nouniverse & Big Bang\n\nIn the beginning, at the centre of it all is the Noggle. The Noggle atom, molecule, cell, animal, vegetable, mineral. We want to place the Noggle at the centre of this big bang and follow the narrative of it's growing impact on the universe.\n\nThis rippling wave will take effect on the world around it, transforming and creating. What does the world look like through a Nounish lens?\n\n### Why hype video?\n\nThe current state of our fast-paced digital world needs information to be condensed into a highly digestible format to relay anything valuable.\n\n[Prop 143](https://nouns.wtf/vote/143) spoke to the fantastic concept of the video marketing funnel. To borrow a term from the Nounish team, we want to talk to the top of the funnel and go even more front-facing, above the funnel. This is why it’s important to create a first point of contact with broader audiences that inspires them to care about what they’re seeing. We want to ignite a spark within viewers to seek out and learn more about Nouns of their own volition.\n\nA hype video executes this perfectly. A short, visually rich video, presented in an artistic, eye-catching way, that grabs people's attention and hooks them in, down the Nouns rabbit hole.\n\n### Do traditional hype videos work in web3?\n\nIt’s well known that video is a perfect medium to promote and create awareness of a brand/product. Hype videos are a tool used by luxury brands within web2 and we want to bring these tried and tested methods to web3 and Nouns.\n\nTake the promo video for [Doodles v2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv9TaQ5z9jw), or the [Otherside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1equGhkQE) Yuga Labs video. These are both great examples of highly crafted, short animated hype videos to blow up awareness of a brand/product to funnel new audiences into web3 and their brand.\n\nThese videos aren't about explaining how, but what and why.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IbzEFzH.gif)\n\n### Video Lifespan\n\nA hype video has a long shelf life and is easy to re-use. Whenever you need promotional content, take an already existing hype video and place it at the front of marketing to interest viewers.\n\nCombine the re-usability of a hype video with assets that are CC0 and you have a piece of art that can be re-used, re-jigged, and a video that can live on for a long time.\n\nRender characters, assets, scenes, and the entire video as CC0 for all to share and spread Nouns proliferation.\n\n### Meta\n\nAir-drop current Noun owners their very own piece of this hype video in the form of NFTs created from scenes of the entire piece. This will create a collection of different NFTs from the entire video.\n\nOwners could even trade/swap/collect these separate NFTs to piece together the sequence and receive a rare airdrop of the entire video minted as an NFT. This is a way to celebrate the creation of the work, and reward holders who were already a part of the ecosystem when it happened.\n\nPOAPs for voters. Incentive to vote, a reward for being involved in bringing this project of Nouns proliferation to life.\n\n## Process\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pjCL5wT.png)\n\n### Process\n\nWe use a traditional linear pipeline for development, from concept through to mastering. This stepped approach allows us to spend an appropriate amount of time in each phase, delivering top notch work in an efficient timeline. At each major milestone, our clients give condensed feedback to ensure that the work is communicating its message clearly.\n\nTo ensure the work is original and ownable, we use a period of time for high level research and development. This means we aren't aiming to re-create a reference, but build something new and ownable for the Nouns DAO.\n\n### Pre production\n\n- R&D (Community liaisons to guide content)\n- Concept art, thumbnails\n- Design, visual language development\n- Storyboarding\n- Animatic\n\n### Production\n\n- Animation\n- Music development\n- NFT + POAP creation\n\n### Post-Production\n\n- Compositing, Grading\n- Sound design\n- Mastering\n\n### Deliverables\n\n- Brand hype video (Widescreen 16:9, 4K, 30fps) [archival master + web ready]\n- Working files\n- NFT ready exports (TBD with community)\n- POAP artwork (TBD with community)\n\n### Production Schedule\n\nPre production to begin before EOY if approved.\n\nFull production starting no later than January 8th, taking approximately 10-12 weeks to complete the final piece.\n\n### Communications\n\nRegular updates and WIP process interaction with the Nouns community is important. We want to build in public and share progress openly.

This is a built-in threshold which can be adjusted at any time with a proposal.\n\n**Proposal to change the threshold from 2 nouns to 1 noun for putting a proposal on chain.**\nThis would allow any address with a minimum of **1 NOUN** to formally propose to the DAO, until the Noun supply reaches **1000**. After that the threshold will be set to 2 again.\n\nThis is an updated version of [Prop 134](https://nouns.wtf/vote/134).",

We don't yet have a problem with spam, and noun ownership is still a lofty bar (nobody is spending 50 ETH for the lulz), so I support lowering the threshold to 1 noun for now. This can always be revisited in future, if and when an over-concentration of low quality proposals becomes a problem. \n\nI think it is much more likely that a good proposal will not make it on chain due to the threshold being 2, than a bad prop will make it on chain because the threshold is only 1.",

We don’t have a proposal spam problem yet (which is why this feature was baked in) so I think it makes sense to lower it to encourage more participation. Last time this was proposed (with a long time period attached that muddied the waters) it was all the brand new Nouners voting yes, which I think was telling. Keep in mind if spam ever became a problem, another proposal could easily raise the threshold again.\n\n**lil bk**\nall in favor of reducing the threshold to propose. entry of barrier to hold a noun is high as is. \n\nthere’s a total of 292 unique noun owners and thus don’t think spam would be an issue. instead, it’ll increase the overall probability to proliferate/propose in the first place. if my counting is correct, there theoretically is only 58 people who can propose as it stands (holding 2 nouns)\n\n**kerimbonia**\ni'm on the fence with this one but starting to lean towards yes the more we chat about it. \ni def agree that anybody buying a noun should be able to put a proposal on-chain and that the cream of proposals will always rise to the top... that might sway my vote (no) concerning added noise to proposals and the additional time investment needed for voters/nouncil to discuss and filter through all of those to give each one the attention they deserve to get. i also think there is something very community about somebody with a noun having to reach out to another to get a proposal on-chain... anyways, still thinking about all this.",

      "description": "# Nouns News - 1 Million Views Challenge\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pgdInAM.gif)\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* Nouns News, a media group dedicated to bringing awareness of all things Nouns through authentic and engaging content across all social channels.\n* GOAL: **1 MILLION VIEWS** - we will return the 5th and last payment to the DAO treasury if we DO NOT reach the goal.\n* Budget: 78 ETH (10 allocated to giveways) for 9 people working for 5 months.\n\n\n\n**SUMMARY**\n\nAfter the success and funding of Nouns News Seasons 1-3, we have expanded our team and efforts to reach a wider audience.\n\nOur strategy is focused on **Top of Funnel marketing** tactics, to capture as many eyes as possible with content that is entertaining, educational, and engaging.\n\n**Objectives**\n\n1. Drive awareness and favorability of Nouns DAO as an innovative leader in the web3 space.\n2. Engage audiences outside of mainstream Web3 with Nouns brand.\n3. Build an authentic perspective through content that drives deeper interest in Nouns DAO.\n\n**Strategy**\n\n**TikTok** is the platform for **virality**. Trending content on TikTok has the ability to inspire people to take action and learn more about Nouns. We will be focusing on staying on top of the trends and tying it into Nouns DAO and Nouns projects. \n\nWe have a 1M views goal we are trying to reach, but the opportunity goes beyond the metrics. It is about increasing **brand awareness, favorability** and **engagement** with other builders, community members and the general public to grow the brand in a positive light and maximize our social presence.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mOTteC7.png)\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PmsnOqf.png)\n\n*Nouns FAQ:*\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FRnb5Da.png)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5f23GnpTuk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5f23GnpTuk)\n\n\n**Innovation** - A new vtube avatar will be designed and used with AI technology to create educational Nouns content. We will be updating our graphics, music and other branding elements.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7dMac35.png)\n\n\n**Cross-Platform Approach** - In order to connect with unique audiences across all platforms, we will repurpose content to each of our social channels (TikTok, Youtube, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and Website). This gives us greater opportunities to rank in search - within the platforms and on Google.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/v14oFDX.png)\n\n\n**Collaborations** - Partnering with other Nouns projects and communities to showcase their nounish products/ideas/initiatives (from IRL projects, like Nouns OTG and Nouns Treasure Hunts, to Nounish product launches, like merch/coffee/goods).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RLBMo4u.png)\n\n\n*Nouns Vision Sunglasses Trend:*\n![](https://i.imgur.com/x8aGIjE.png)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCz3B4Q6adk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCz3B4Q6adk)\n\n**Contests & Giveaways** - Giveaways are one of the most powerful content types, as they are a great entry point for new members. We’d like to continue hosting weekly or bi-weekly contests, with ETH prizes and/or nounish products from our collaborations. We’d like to focus not only on rewarding new members online, **but also people who participate in public video shoots.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/B1ek5UU.png)\n\n\n*Brandweek Miami 2022:*\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2BFwCU4.png)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6ey8FY-B0w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6ey8FY-B0w)\n\n**Community Involvement** - We will interact with all the nounish communitites, delivering monthly reports on our progress and implementing new and creative ideas with their feedback.\n\n\n**BY THE NUMBERS**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/i6IO3Op.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oAWB1xy.png)\n\n\n\n*Some of the top performing posts:*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vpnaXVB.png)\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ8PJM9h1ys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ8PJM9h1ys)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wFbJ3KA.png)\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OmZuSnDYxY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OmZuSnDYxY)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iGwJwlt.png)\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9A73BHeB1gM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9A73BHeB1gM)\n\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZK0hhaq.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Pis2hTv.png)\n\n\n**TEAM**\n\n\n**Director/Producer**\n**Leo Clark**: [@leoclark](https://twitter.com/leoclark), Discord:leoclark.eth ⌐◨-◨#2267\nFilmmaker @ Nouns DAO Prop #71 • Nouncillor • Producer/Speaker @ Nouns in Rio Prop #98.\n\n**Content Presenter/Host**\n**Nikki**: [@web3nikki](https://twitter.com/web3nikki), Discord:NonfungibleNikki#0001\nMiami-based web3 strategist at an influencer marketing agency.\n\n**Content Strategist**\n**Hypnos**: [@hypnoseffect](https://twitter.com/hypnoseffect), Discord:Hypnos#0007\nMiami-based former professional gamer.

      "description": "# Noundry Community Compensation\n\nThis proposal aims to retroactively compensate the Noundry community for their part in making Season 0 a success. Total ask of 25 eth.\n\nWe believe the community is largely to thank for making Noundry into something more than a mere contest. Instead, the Noundry evolved into a collaborative experience — a festival — where artists from around the world came together to inspire and build upon each other's ideas, using Nouns pixel art as a canvas to unite around.\n\nThe artwork we eventually added to the Nouns Descriptor contract resulted from a group effort and would not have been the same without the participation of the larger community.\n\nWith this proposal, we want to acknowledge that the collaborative, explorative side of the Noundry is as vital as the outcome and hope to set an example for upcoming Noundrys.\n\n## Compensation\n\n### Community compensation\n\nWe think community compensation is best left to the community to decide. The alternatives would be equal distribution to all participants or attempting the almost impossible task of centrally deciding who had a meaningful impact on the Noundry. None of these options feel exciting or in the spirit of the Noundry.\n\nTo manage this, we're using [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/), a community compensation platform, and want to allocate a pool of 24 eth for the Noundry season 0 community to split up amongst themselves.\n \n\n**Coordinape rules**\n- Participants eligible to vote: [https://hackmd.io/@krel/noundry-coordinape](https://hackmd.io/@krel/noundry-coordinape)\n- Each participant receives three votes\n- Participants allocate votes based on who they think had the largest positive impact on their own experience\n- Participants cannot vote for themselves\n- Participants cannot vote for artists with winning traits in Noundry Season 0\n    - Facu, Gremplin, Goldy, Modrovsky, LuckyCryptoCats, Fuyu, Nountris\n\n**Total: 24 eth**\n\n### Summary\n- Coordinape round: 24 eth\n- Administration (run by maty): 1 eth\n- **Total compensation: 25 eth**\n\n### Transactions\n-  1 eth to maty\n    -  0x3E3928d651b431608F81Dd1129a56344d6A256EC\n-  24 eth to Gnosis Safe with 3/5 signers\n    -  0x8a4eb8f3383909a8138101F6E17cd8281a26eA3a\n\n**Multisig signers**\n\n- (maty) 0xDEAD753f9B1eb8F2f7372E8587e7C6e342daac89\n- (krel) 0xFFb0E93F7e315BECcF0757845F3eF2cB9832efB9\n- (elad) 0xfe9b3ab16AfeF3B28C0c3dfA6fa7C5b58f5c06aA\n- (9999) 0x6223Bc5fd16a19bcFAe2281dDE47861CFE1023eE\n- (142)  0xE6232ed3436C4065D38D8BFdC8EA90858ecDfa69",

          "reason": "> This doesn't have to mean that every year we neccesarily reward the community for contributions to any other noundry upgrades this way (if we set expectations/rewards ahead of time especially, it should be much cleaner next time), but this past year it was an all-in group effort where a lot of value was created by many of the artists who ultimately didn't make it into the final collection. If we’re retroactively rewarding the winners and committee (without rules ahead of time) it feels fair and honest to also share some of that with the a wider set of contributors to the process. The downside feels limited, and curious to see how these funds get shared around. Hopefully with very limited GIVES per coordinape participants, this is going to reward the top contributors as judged by the community. ⌐◨-◨",

I'm of the view that anyone who took the time to contribute some art should get rewarded, irrespective of how many they submitted, quality of work or who they interacted with. I'm in favour of a simple pro-rata of ETH amongst the number of artists. We could setup clearer guidelines for rewards next season\n\n ~~ JoelCares ~~\n Personally think this would be fun, help build community across the broad group of participants, and give the community a voice in evaluating quality. The current structure (3 GIVE tokens) would not be rewarding general participation, it would be rewarding the runner up work valued most by the community.",

      "description": "# Nounish Friends - Stage 2\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Dcj8zF9.jpg)\n\n___\n**I. WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?**\n___\nDesigned for maximum NOUNish-ness, these colorful 3” tall mini figures are meant to be a fun, low cost and non-crypto-based entry point into the world of “NOUNs.” Nounish Friends will be packed into colorful mystery boxes and presented in eye catching counter display cartons which are found in shops worldwide.\nProp 72 funded with 20ETH to take this project from initial idea, through countless iterations, to the current designs & prototypes. We have communicated updates weekly on the [Discord here](https://discord.com/channels/849745721544146955/973957832015761428) and have had many conversations on [Discourse here](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nounish-friends-nouns-town-collectible-figures-and-more-by-bigshottoyworks/967/42?page=3&fbclid=IwAR2b6AnS2-xKAbn0eja5dL0k1LCufZM4v_nT5NbJXzZ_ZWWb5FEo_PIxly8), gathering feedback from over 50 comments to arrive at the final designs we’re proposing today. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mJ5emSS.jpg)\n\n___\n**II. PROJECT DEVELOPMENT COSTS:**\n___\n**CURRENT STAGE:**\n - **Engineering:**  tooling masters, paint masks, production molds, Packaging, Final branding, box and display box design and dies: $45K ***(one time cost)***\n - **Manufacturing:** $53K for 10K pcs \n - **Logistics/warehousing:** $29K\n - **Marketing, project management & B2B & B2C sales:** $40K for 6 months. This involves sample photography,press, targeted social media engagement, onboarding  and follow ups, potential partner onboarding and communications. This includes unexpected sample creations and air shipping for events such as Art Basel, Dcon, NFTNYC and other opportunities world wide while the mass production run is being produced.\n - **TOTAL ASK:** $167K USD\n\n**PAYMENT SCHEDULE:**\nPayments to be broken down into 3 milestones as follows: \n - **35% upfront** ($58,450 USD)\nPreproduction deposit for further final development of graphics, packaging templates, tooling molds, paint molds, and final samples.\n - **35% on Milestone 1** ($58,450 USD)\nDeposit for mass production deposit once tooling test shots and painted counter sample approvals,\n - **30% on Milestone 2** (50,100 USD)\nFull balance paid out once production passes testing. QC inspection and is ready to ship to our warehouse by sea.\n\n**PAYMENT DETAILS**\n - **GNOSIS SAFE**\nETH will be sent to a 2/3 Gnosis Safe with the following signers:\nBigshot Klim - 0xd25912007EBC2527d4ED9DC536f928E550b0f02C\nJoshua Fisher - JoshuaFisher.eth\nJoel Cares - JoelCares.eth\n\n - **ETH -> USD CONVERSION**\nCalculations done on 9/14/2022 at $1,600 USD / ETH\nProject Cost = $167,000 USD = 104.38 ETH\nVolatility Buffer (10%) = 10.44 ETH\nTOTAL ASK = 114.82 ETH \n\n - **PROCEDURE**\n   - A 10% buffer was added to the ask to account for volatility in ETH prices prior to conversion.\n   - Upon recieving the funds Gnosis Safe operators will immediately convert ETH to USDC to cover total Project Cost. The USDC will be held in the safe and released to Bigshot Klim when Milestones are completed.\n   - If for any reason there are excess funds (ETH remaining  after conversion, milestones not hit) any unspent funds will be returned to Nouns DAO.\n   - If the value of ETH falls sufficiently before conversion and this value no longer covers project costs another proposal will be submitted to cover the difference. \n\n - **TRANSACTION**\ntransfer 114.82 ETH to 0xA04D191Ae755c442B5e4a0ea10136b7B0354cC6a\n\n___\n**III. FUTURE STEPS**\n___\n\nOur 10,000 physical toys will be utilized for both sales and giveaways for maximum reach and value. We believe that both are important aspect of this proof of concept model moving forward:\n\n - 10% -1,000 toys(100 sets) allocated to community members and other Nouns initiatives like Nouns OTG, Rose Bowl and Art Basel Miami etc. Final production Toys will be allocated and shipped from our warehouse (worldwide approx shipping/handling cost $35 per case of toys) \n - 9,000 units to be sold at SRP $14/toy, or approx $7 wholesale + shipping. Portion of the sales will be used to develop series 2 and put forth in a proposal if the project is a success. \n - Option for DAO allocated additional quantities from this edition at $7/unit \n - Option to re-order at lower unit cost ($5-6/unit) in a future run.\n - Option to create unique colorways & revised single-unit packaging at lower unit cost.\n - A collectible card with a POAP is included with each toy. Use TBD, but it will help with future engagement and retain customer attention.Collectors and fans could receive digital goodies, participate in games, contests or win prizes from our NOUNWORKS shop, and/or have access to unique experiences for POAP holders only. Goodies and prizes can be things in our shops or future items from the community based on the promotions and future partnerships and collaborations(TBD) based on Nounish partners and collaborations.\n\nIt is imperative that we expedite manufacturing so that we can have product ready for public introduction and review at Designercon in November 18-20 2022 (10X20 Booth booked), Art Basel in Miami in December, and possible availability for distribution at Rose Bowl (Jan 1, 2023) with Stoopid Buddy Studios. We can support global meet ups with products as well as some blank figures for local artists to paint.\n\n\n\nAll of the items ship from a central location in USA so the marketing and proliferation logistics are perfectly aligned. These steps, including ongoing press and social media support, are crucial to any project of this scope and everything has a price. Since we have multiple ongoing projects with NOUNs and plan many more, we want to be as efficient as possible with our time as well as resources.\nWe are excited to create and distribute the very best  Nouns toys! We have built out a model that is scalable for large-scale runs in the future after this concept is proven.\n",

      "description": "# Founding Partners of NFT Seattle\n\n(*TLDR, NFT Seattle is the first large scale Web3 event in the entire Pacific Northwest. We think it would be pretty sweet if the Nouns came in as title sponsors of this inaugural event*)\n\n### **DESCRIPTION**\n\n- Becoming the Nounding Partners / Presenting Sponsors of NFT Seattle creates an opportunity for the Nouns to build relationships with the Pacific Northwest’s Web3 community and solidify the Noun meme in the foundation of these new relationships.\n- As we establish Seattle as a hub for Web3 innovation, we'd love for the Nouns to come in at the ground level and cement the meme as an integral part of Seattle’s Web3 ecosystem, positioned for maximum and lasting brand exposure. The Web3 community is still growing in Seattle so the probability of reaching new people (vs people that already know about the Nouns) is likely higher here, than most other major US cities. Plus Seattle's technically inclined demographic lends itself well to everything the Nouns stand for, though people here are still warming up to the whole idea of NFT's.\n\n### **WHAT IS NFT SEATTLE**\n\n- NFT Seattle is the first event catering to the broader Web3 community in the Pacific Northwest (Portland, Seattle, Vancouver, BC).\n- The vision behind NFT Seattle is to establish Seattle as a hub for Web3 innovation & connect the growing community in the Northwest. We want to unite people in Seattle to educate & expose them to the opportunities & possibilities that Web3 brings to creators, businesses, artists, and communities.\n- This event is mainly targeting the Web3 curious and as such, has a heavier leaning towards education.\n- NFT Seattle will take place from 9/30/2022 - 10/1/2022 in Seattle at several venues including Block 41 and the Seattle NFT Museum (the worlds first NFT Museum).\n\n### **WHY SHOULD NOUNS BE INVOLVED & WHY IT MATTERS?**\n\n- NFT Seattle presents a unique opportunity for the Nouns to proliferate the Nouns meme and imagery (think, Noggles in downtown Seattle) across a region that is still trying to figure out Web3 but is on the cusp of a major Web3 breakout. A region that has already cemented itself as a global hub for technological and cultural innovation, with everything from Amazon/Microsoft to Starbucks and many more having been birthed here.\n- As the first Web3 event in the Pacific Northwest, NFT Seattle will draw people in from Portland, Seattle, Vancouver BC and will lean heavily towards education plus fostering deep, meaningful connection between brands, thought leaders and other attendees. Early data suggests the audience will be a healthy mix between the Web3 curious, and those that are pioneering in the space.\n- This event also creates a perfect opportunity for an IRL Noun meetup, for Nouns that are local to the region to come and engage with the local community while providing *Nouns on the Ground* an opportunity to execute their existing IRL events strategy, in a new untapped market. Also, hoping to partner with the Nounish marketing team to up-level the Nounishness of this activation if the prop passes. (Initial conversations have been started).\n\n### **THE BREAKDOWN**\n\n- **Presenting Title Sponsor of NFT Seattle** (”NFT Seattle presented by the Nouns”). Nouns branding will be prominently featured at the Event and the official After Party.\n    \n \n![](https://i.imgur.com/jDWDkc8.png)\n\n\n    \n- **Live Art Premier** that is nouns-inspired and incorporates the noggles, showcased by local high profile NFT artist [Jaiden ‘Jasti’ Stipp](https://www.instagram.com/jastidesigns/), the 16yr old that made over a million selling NFT's.\n- As a way of thanking the Nouns for being a founding event partner for NFT Seattle, this commemorative art-piece will become a permanent fixture at every NFT Seattle annual event, an exclusive benefit only being extended to the Nouns. We’ll store this piece for future use, or the Nouns can opt to claim it for use at other IRL events.\n- **Evergreen Video Content** to drive meme awareness and exposure: 2 daily sizzle Reels to be shared upon completion of each event day specifically highlighting the Nouns, and 1 sizzle Reel showcasing the creation of the custom mural. Video content to be produced by local media partner Brandtegic.\n- **Nouns Branding exclusively featured on each String Backpack** provided to all attendees upon entry. Nouns stickers and swag will also be included in each swag bag (we'd need help designing the stickers).\n    \n![](https://i.imgur.com/poa1pxT.jpg)\n\n\n    \n- **Nouns Branding prominently featured on Social, Website, and Emails** that will be widely visible to all attendees, the public, and reviewed by various news outlets and media partners. We just recently kicked off a regional PR campaign, the Nouns imagery will be added to the the forefront of all marketing materials associated with the event as a title sponsor.\n\n- **Fireside chat with a Noun**, an optional speaking opportunity where a designated Noun can share a bit about how the Nouns continue to play a key role in the advancement of the overall DAO ecosystem via the prop house model or a deep dive into cc0 NFT's, using Nouns as a use-case.\n\n\n### **THE ASK**\n\nThis is a title sponsorship for NFT Seattle, and cost breakdown will be as follows:\n\n- $65,000 USD ~ 40 ETH (calculated at 1 ETH = $1,600)\n    - 10 ETH - Towards venue costs + event production team (labor)\n    - 16 ETH - Towards A/V production + other venue related expenses\n    - 10 ETH - Towards PR campaign, advertising, event marketing, videographers and video editing. (This includes printing graphics for all Nouns signage and marketing materials)\n    - 4 ETH - Live painted Nouns inspired mural/art piece by Jasti (reusable at future events)\n    \n    ***N.B.** This cost also factors in event admission for Nouns that wish to attend (up until a pre-negotiated number) as well as an optional booth activation, if there are nouns on the ground available to man it.*\n    \n\n### **WHY SEATTLE**\n\n- Seattle is an emerging market in Web3 with events just starting to take place. (ETHSeattle, blockchain events, and now NFT Seattle)\n- Starbucks is entering Web3 and launching an NFT collection ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/05/04/starbucks-teases-web-3-platform-in-nft-announcement/)) and it’s in good company among other major brands with a substantial presence in Washington who are either ALL-IN or dabbling in Web3- Salesforce, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple.\n- Besides SF, Seattle has more tech talent than any other city in the country ([425 Business](https://www.425business.com/news/greater-seattle-no-2-in-tech-talent-report/article_37815015-8e5d-58f2-81fa-593715c7f695.html)) and it’s also the country’s most desired location for people aged 18 to 24 ([Bankrate](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/cost-of-living/seattle-wa/)), making the city an ideal place for Web3 brands to establish a presence in order to attract and retain top talent.\n- 75% or more of PNW Angel Investors are interested in Web3 companies and founders. ([Madrona Venture Group](https://www.madrona.com/angel-investors-pacific-northwest-directory/))\n- Seattle is the US’ primary gateway to Asia, the best city in America for outdoor activities, the 13th best city to live in overall, and the eighth-best city for raising a family. ([Patch.com](https://patch.com/washington/seattle/seattle-ranks-high-2022-best-places-live-list))\n- There is a growing list of startups in Seattle building crypto, blockchain, and Web3 technologies such as Irreverent Labs, CoinMe, Nori, ArcBlock, Bittrex, CypherD, DragonChain, Luxor (Source: [GeekWire](https://www.geekwire.com/2022/a-list-of-startups-in-seattle-building-crypto-blockchain-and-web3-technologies/))\n\n### **THE TEAM BEHIND THE PROPOSAL**\n\nWe’re a team of builders from diverse cultures and backgrounds, united by the goal of advancing the adoption of Web3 technologies.\n\n- **Tessa Mero** ([@tesssamero](https://twitter.com/tessamero)) - VP of Developer Relations at Appwrite, over a decade of experience organizing events. She recently co-organized the [ReFiSummit](https://refisummit.org/) event.\n- **Mark Robinson** ([@markarobinson_](https://twitter.com/markarobinson_)) - Partner at [Brandtegic](https://www.brandtegic.co/), a creative content agency, and the host of the ‘Marketing in the Metaverse’ podcast.\n- **Lennox Matsinde** ([@lennoxtakura](https://twitter.com/lennoxtakura)) - Product Management at Starbucks Corporate, Founder of Satoshi’s Index NFT (a token gated SaaS Platform) and Founder of Inyasha Capital (Seattle based Quant Fund).\n- **EXP Events** - Local Event Planning, Coordination, & Production Company and the production partner for Alaska Airlines, Microsoft, President Joe Biden, World Relief.\n- **The Seattle NFT Museum** ([@seanftmuseum](https://twitter.com/seanftmuseum)) - The world’s first NFT Museum highlighting everything from educational exhibits to coveted 1-of-1 pieces, and hosting consistent live community events. The museum is founded by Seattle locals, the art-loving and community-focused entrepreneurs, Jennifer Wong ([@Jenerationy](https://twitter.com/Jenerationy)), the Head of Sustainability at Convoy and Peter Hamilton ([@PeterHamilton](https://twitter.com/PeterHamilton)), the Head of Television Commerce at Roku, Former CEO at TUNE, Advisor, Mentor, Board Member to various startups & companies.\n\nLinks:\n[Twitter ](https://twitter.com/nftseattle_io)\n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nftseattle.io/)\n[Website](https://www.nftseattle.io/) \n\nShout out to our sponsoring Noun @brennen.eth who we've been working with on this proposal and everyone else that provided feedback on the initial draft.",

And we can assume (at this point) anyone putting up the capital to buy a noun will come with a thoughtful proposal. If one nouners are required to find someone else to co-sign a proposal then there's not much difference between having a noun and not having a noun. \n\nIf we wanted to change the threshold at a later date it would require thoughtful consideration and discussion, rather than continuing to kick the can down the road and lowering the threshold every few months.",

Additionally, some of the most active Nouns contributors got their start in SharkDAO.\n\nSuccessful proposals:\n\n-   Prop 8 - FOMO Nouns\n-   Prop 12 - Perpetual Glasses to Kids In Need V2\n-   Prop 20 - Nouns Stories\n-   Prop 56 - FUN Noggles Stage 2\n-   Prop 68 - Nouns Esports\n-   Prop 70 - Nouns CC0 Story Foundations & Development\n-   Prop 104 - Free Glasses for Kids v4\n-   Prop 116 - Monthly Nouns Comic\n\nThe time has come to raise our contributor game to the next level by deploying Shark Labs, an open creative laboratory and incubator focused on supporting Nounish creatives in developing and submitting deliverables to Nouns on a regular basis, led by core SharkDAO contributors.\n\n# What is Shark Labs?\n\nShark Labs is a cohort of SharkDAO contributors that are actively working to support, develop, and ship Nounish projects. SharkLabs will operate under 3 main outlets to achieve our goals:\n\n-   **Art**\n-   **Development**\n-   **Media**\n\nSharkDAO has a unique identity as a more accessible avenue for participation in the Nouns ecosystem. We attract many builders, artists, and creatives, with more to come as a result of our upcoming PFP project. The mission of Shark Labs is to implement a structure in which we can more efficiently utilize and support contributors in deploying projects that add value to Nouns with a regular cadence.\n\n----------\n\n![_15.png](https://snapshot.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafkreibexnxvx74cecnj2mgfwnl7zqg2x7trkxbpvxv3he3rcu3evcj4za)\n\n_Excerpt from the Shark Street Comic #2, by Maty_\n\n----------\n\n# Outlet Details\n\n-   **Art Reef:**  Art Reef: An art laboratory supporting emerging and established nounish creatives in addding content to Nouns lore and creating cc0 art for both SharkDAO & Nouns DAO. For this period, the Art Reef is interested in offering grants for projects that add background stories and personality to Nouns characters.\n    \n-   **Builders Bay:**  Advise and support the planning, development, and implementation of open source software projects that are focused on adding value to the SharkDAO/ NounsDAO ecosystem. For this funding period, the Development outlet will operate with an emphasis on attracting more builders to the Nouns ecosystem, funding and advising projects that seek to create efficiencies in coordination and collaboration amongst Sharks & Nouners, as well as tools that streamline processes for evaluating and awarding project grants and retroactive funding.\n    \n-   **Media Cove:**  Oversee the production of various media efforts designed to promote and educate those interested in the SharkDAO/ NounsDAO ecosystem, keep Sharks and Nouners informed about the latest initiatives, and perpetuate the Nounish culture through appropriate mediums. In this cycle, the Media Cove is focused on producing calculated 'outward facing' content that is designed to draw newcomers to the Nouns ecosystem.\n    \n\n# Operational Structure\n\n-   If passed, the funds from this proposal will be equally split (33 ETH each) between the 3 outlets. For transparency and efficiency, 5 signers will be nominated to sit on a dedicated multisig.\n-   Each outlet will be managed by a trusted SharkDAO contributor. The outlet managers will be responsible for keeping projects on track, providing updates to NounsDAO, and organizing the election of committee members and multi-sig signers.\n    -   Art Reef — Marxistmillionaire\n    -   Builders Bay — Nick Dodson\n    -   Media Cove — Cryptasha\n-   DAO members submit project ideas to the outlets for a committee of fellow contributors to deliberate and advise. Project funds are released following a review by the committee members.\n    -   Committee members (subject to change)\n        -   Chris Carella\n        -   Cryptasha\n        -   Marxistmillionaire\n        -   Sasquatch\n        -   Joshua Fisher\n        -   Yungweez\n        -   Nick Dodson\n-   Bi-weekly Shark Labs updates will be posted in the Nouns discord.\n\n# Expected Deliverables\n\nWhile many deliverables will result from projects and ideas which will be surfaced as a result of Shark Labs, here is what Nouners can definitively expect to be shipped during this period.\n\n-   **Art Reef**\n    \n    -   Shark Street Comic (issues #3 to #5)\n        -   SharkDAO’s very own comic series, telling the backstories of our six Nouns. More details  [here](https://www.notion.so/The-Shark-Street-Comic-0efa96404f5d440b862383f0088131be).\n        -   Budget: 15 ETH\n    -   Shark Art Residency\n        -   Incubator program for emerging artists, granting online residencies as an easy access into Shark DAO and the Nouns ecosystem. More details  [here](https://www.notion.so/The-Shark-Art-Residency-dc1aab1cdb26415d88bde191cb4f8326).\n        -   Budget: 13 ETH\n    -   Ancillary reserve:\n        -   Budget: 5 ETH\n-   **Builders Bay**\n    \n    -   Creator Contests\n        -   Retroactive funding contests for contributors. More details  [here](https://www.notion.so/Creator-Contests-b68fc53bb8d549a4b4e7dbf8dd3e4c34).\n        -   Budget: 18 ETH\n    -   Shark Builders Residency\n        -   Small grants program for Nounish devs and designers. More details  [here](https://www.notion.so/Builders-Residency-Program-ca1ce9d6d9484e5085ccc5dc1304bde9).\n        -   Budget: 15 ETH\n-   **Media Cove**\n    \n    -   Shark Tank\n        -   Weekly twitter spaces, which will give updates on what's happening in SharkDAO, NounsDAO and invite guests from other DAO / CC0 communities to speak.\n        -   Budget: 6 ETH\n    -   SharkDAO Podcast\n        -   Through various episodes and segments, SharkDAO will inform active members, proliferate the Nounish brand, and educate curious outsiders. We will operate with an emphasis on drawing new members to the Nouns ecosystem.\n        -   Budget: 22 ETH\n    -   Ancillary reserve:\n        -   5 ETH\n    \n    More details about all current Media Cove projects  [here](https://www.notion.so/Media-Cove-7f69dbf6c3c64d5087730f2586418c46).\n    \n\n# Proposed Transactions\n\nTransfer a total of 99 ETH to the Shark Lab multisig\n\n-   Address: 0x6ED21E7284400e5E785aCF161DF05bd815f26C7e\n-   Signers: Nick Dodson, Cryptasha, Marxistmillionaire, Sasquatch, Joshua Fisher\n\n# What is Shark DAO?\n\n-   A group of web3 enthusiasts that pooled together funds in order to participate in the Nouns ecosystem, proliferate Nouns culture, and ship web3 projects.\n-   Founded in July 2021.\n-   Currently holding 6 Nouns.\n-   Consistent NounsDAO governance participants and proposal submitters.\n\n# Find out more about us\n\nTwitter —  [https://twitter.com/sharkdao](https://twitter.com/sharkdao)\n\nDiscord —  [https://discord.gg/xXByPBTrUe](https://discord.gg/xXByPBTrUe)\n\nSnapshot —  [https://snapshot.org/#/sharkdao.eth](https://snapshot.org/#/sharkdao.eth)\n\n----------\n\n![enter image description here](https://snapshot.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafybeicw74qfcolooc2uvj2vn3qf7qvlp6aygmm2yjvsvwbq4ltachny7u)\n\n_POAP for our “Shark-versary Spaces”, by Messhup_",

          "reason": "Judge: The defense may proceed.\n\nRoark: Your Honor, I shall call no witnesses. This will be my testimony and my summation.\n\nJudge: Take the oath.\n\nCourt Clerk: Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\n\nRoark: I do.\n\nThousands of years ago, the first man discovered how to make fire. He was probably burned at the stake he had taught his brothers to light, but he left them a gift they had not conceived, and he lifted darkness off the earth.\n\nThroughout the centuries, there were men who took first steps down new roads, armed with nothing but their own vision. The great creators -- the thinkers, the artists, the scientists, the inventors -- stood alone against the men of their time. Every new thought was opposed; every new invention was denounced. But the men of unborrowed vision went ahead. They fought, they suffered, and they paid. But they won.\n\nNo creator was prompted by a desire to please his brothers. His brothers hated the gift he offered.\n\nHis truth was his only motive.\n\nHis work was his only goal.\n\nHis work -- not those who used it.\n\nHis creation -- not the benefits others derived from it -- the creation which gave form to his truth.\n\nHe held his truth above all things and against all men. He went ahead whether others agreed with him or not, with his integrity as his only banner. He served nothing and no one. He lived for himself. And only by living for himself was he able to achieve the things which are the glory of mankind. Such is the nature of achievement. Man cannot survive except through his mind. He comes on earth unarmed. His brain is his only weapon. But the mind is an attribute of the individual. There is no such thing as a collective brain. The man who thinks must think and act on his own. The reasoning mind cannot work under any form of compulsion. It cannot be subordinated to the needs, opinions, or wishes of others. It is not an object of sacrifice.\n\nThe creator stands on his own judgment; the parasite follows the opinions of others.\n\nThe creator thinks; the parasite copies.\n\nThe creator produces; the parasite loots.\n\nThe creator's concern is the conquest of nature; the parasite's concern is the conquest of men.\n\nThe creator requires independence. He neither serves nor rules. He deals with men by free exchange and voluntary choice.\n\nThe parasite seeks power. He wants to bind all men together in common action and common slavery. He claims that man is only a tool for the use of others -- that he must think as they think, act as they act, and live in selfless, joyless servitude to any need but his own.\n\nLook at history: Everything we have, every great achievement has come from the independent work of some independent mind. Every horror and destruction came from attempts to force men into a herd of brainless, soulless robots -- without personal rights, without person ambition, without will, hope, or dignity.\n\nIt is an ancient conflict. It has another name: \"The individual against the collective.\"\n\nOur country, the noblest country in the history of men, was based on the principle of individualism, the principle of man's \"inalienable rights.\" It was a country where a man was free to seek his own happiness, to gain and produce, not to give up and renounce; to prosper, not to starve; to achieve, not to plunder; to hold as his highest possession a sense of his personal value, and as his highest virtue his self-respect.\n\nLook at the results. That is what the collectivists are now asking you to destroy, as much of the earth has been destroyed.\n\nI am an architect. I know what is to come by the principle on which it is built. We are approaching a world in which I cannot permit myself to live. My ideas are my property. They were taken from me by force, by breach of contract. No appeal was left to me.\n\nIt was believed that my work belonged to others, to do with as they pleased. They had a claim upon me without my consent -- that it was my duty to serve them without choice or reward.\n\nNow you know why a dynamited Courtland. I designed Courtland. I made it possible. I destroyed it. I agreed to design it for the purpose of it seeing built as I wished. That was the price I set for my work. I was not paid. My building was disfigured at the whim of others who took all the benefits of my work and gave me nothing in return.\n\nI came here to say that I do not recognize anyone's right to one minute of my life, nor to any part of my energy, nor to any achievement of mine -- no matter who makes the claim!\n\nIt had to be said: The world is perishing from an orgy of self-sacrificing. I came here to be heard in the name of every man of independence still left in the world. I wanted to state my terms. I do not care to work or live on any others.\n\nMy terms are: A man's RIGHT to exist for his own sake.",

      "description": "# Nouns Jokedao Grant\n\nDiscourse link: [https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-jokedao-for-nouns/1836](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-jokedao-for-nouns/1836)\n\n## Description\n\njokedao has built the first on-chain, bottom-up governance platform for communities to submit proposals and vote on their favorites; it enables community-set governance for user-generated roadmaps, grants, endorsements, bounties, curation, and contests.\n\nOne of the major benefits of on-chain voting is that it can allow for extensible contracts—that is, transactions that automatically execute depending on the results of a vote. For example, a community could vote on who to receive funds or what NFT to buy or even mint, and depending on the result of the vote, the transaction would be executed.\n\nMore excitingly, it also enables composable governance that could combine different transactions. For example, a community could vote on different features for an NFT, and the top three options could be combined to mint a unique image reflecting the different votes.\n\nExtensible contracts would enable a whole new generation of projects in the Nouns ecosystem.\n\nSome examples, please: how will this proliferate Nouns?\n\nWe imagine Nouns forks in the future won’t simply replicate Nouns but develop unique minting and auction mechanisms of their own to innovate on the Nouns playbook—not simply its art, but its model.\n\nHere are a few examples of Nouns forks that jokedao could enable through extensible contracts:\n\nCreate-a-Noun. Communities could submit and vote on the different properties of a Nouns that could then be automatically generated to incorporate each of the individual qualities.\n\nUser-generated Nouns. Enable NFT-derived voting power so that communities could create interactive Nouns projects in which the holders of NFTs could collectively submit and vote on the design of each subsequent NFT.\n\nNouns governance giveaways. Every 10th Noun (derivative) could be given away to a member of the community who had voted on the most winning options in the previous 9 contests, in order to incentivize voting and reward those who build social consensus with a community to vote on winning options.\n\nNouns governance rewards. Rewards (NFTs, Poaps, tokens, portions of the treasury, etc.) could be given away to those who have voted consistently in Nouns proposals in order to incentivize active participation.\n\nOn-chain Nouns Grants. jokedao could collaborate with Prop House to enable fully on-chain and open-source grants for communities to use to incentivize builders to develop their NFT universe.\n\n## Context\n\njokedao started as a Nouns fork through its proof-of-concept, the jokerace—a weekly contest in which the community of $JOKE holders votes on the 2nd best joke of the week, which is minted as an NFT that’s sold on a recurring basis. It is likely the first case in which an NFT collection was fully community-created. Since launching in the spring, the jokerace has regularly drawn around 100 weekly players who return each week, consistently sold NFTs, and incentivized the creation of teams that compete. In other words, as a DAO, it’s organically incentivized the creation of subDAOs without input or management from the core team.\n\nSince then, jokedao has built a platform with scaffold eth for creating and running contests by minting voting tokens and sharing them with communities. Currently 8 EVM-compatible chains are supported so communities can deploy contests and voting tokens on Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, etc. We are relaunching with clean, beautiful UI in a few weeks.\n\nProjects like MetricsDAO and Backdrop already use jokedao for contests with their community, and jokedao has soft commits from about another dozen projects in the space to use it for governance after the site relaunch—many of these are NFT projects looking to give their communities more ways to collectively create NFTs themselves. Other popular use cases include grants, giveaways, and content creators letting their communities tell them what kind of content to create.\n\nFinally, let’s emphasize that neither bottom-up nor on-chain governance have been unlocked in NFTs or DAOs to date. Projects typically give few avenues for their communities to express their ideas or cocreate beyond approving proposals of a core team. And on-chain governance has been prohibitive due to gas fees until the past few months.\n\nBoth of these unlock exciting opportunities for DAOs and NFT projects to create far more inclusive and incentivized communities—as we’ve seen with both Nouns and the jokerace.\n\n## Why?\n\nNouns is unique among NFT projects for a number of reasons—but perhaps most of all that it’s the only NFT project with the means and model to incentivize builders to develop its ecosystem’s value through forks, homages, expansion packs, and next-generation projects. No other NFT project has this.\n\nJokedao’s thesis is that the next wave of NFTs and DAOs will be far more interactive and community-governed than this last wave—which has primarily seen centralized figures appealing to consumers to support them, rather than to actively cocreate. Nouns has shown the strongest evidence of this trend, and it seems clear that the next generation of NFT DAOs will go further in letting their communities compete, team up, and create as fun forms of gamified governance. Nouns is in the best position to support these projects within its own ecosystem to grow its value, and jokedao would love to team up to make it happen.\n\n## Deliverables\n\nExtensible contract module: enabling contests to automatically execute transactions depending on the result of a vote\nCreator submission control: enabling only contest creators to submit options for a community to choose from (avoiding user-generated code that may have issues)\nComposable contracts: enabling different winning votes to be combined, for example to combine different properties of a Nouns into a new NFT\nCore Team\n\nDavid Phelps is a 2x SaaS founder who cofounded ecodao, created a web3 angels collective (cowfund), advises TCG Crypto, is a Gitcoin Steward, and writes on web3 on his substack and twitter 1. He was named one of the top 20 leaders in the DAO space by Seed Club.\n\nSean McCaffery is a Software and Data Engineer with a background in building systems for finance and data analytics firms, is building DAOs including Juicebox and the towers three, and has been the engineer of jokedao’s entire current site. Here is their GitHub 1 and Twitter.\n\nNaomi Hauret has been a front-end developer for the past 6 years. She’s designed and developed Tombheadzzz, developed the UI and frontend for ftm.bet, and has designed and developed holodevdao, a derivate NFT viewer for the Dev NFTs of Developer DAO. You can see her github here 1.\n\n## Budget\n\nWe anticipate extensible contracts to be a 10-week project, and we pay each member $2,000 USD per week. At current prices, total projected costs run around 50 eth.",

An Animated Pilot* is a 2D tradigital animated 11-minute episode as seen in the [Prop 70 (CC0 Pitchbook)](https://nouns.wtf/vote/70). The show is an animated comedy following the surreal adventures of best friends balancing the desire for mature adulthood and their reluctance to grow up.\n\n# **We propose doing a pilot in 3 phases.**\n**1) Script and Casting (weeks 1-6)** **$150K** \n*-1st milestone Deliver Script Tk01 Draft (End of Week 3)*\n**2) Animatic (weeks 4-11) $200K** \n*-2nd milestone Deliver Storyboards (End of Week 9)*\n**3) Final Animation (weeks 10-16) $150K** \n\nWe are targeting the schedule for ~16 weeks. However, we may need some flexiblity and increase the time it takes to deliver the pilot to ensure we can put out the best product possible.\nIf we start at the beginning of August, we can deliver before the year end.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mKXuW47.jpg)\n\n## **Phase 1: Scripting and Casting** \nThis phase would last for four-six weeks.\nDuring this phase we would work on the outline, script, script revisions and cast the episode.\nStart Date: **08/01/22** \n\n## **Phase 2: Preproduction**\nStarting week 4, we would begin Phase 2.\nThis phase would last seven weeks.\nDuring this phase, we will thumbnail, and storyboard, refine character designs, and backgrounds, create digital puppets and record scratch tracks and audio.\nStart Date: **08/22/22**\n\n## **Phase 3: Production/ Post**\nStarting week 10, we would begin Phase 3.\nThis phase is where the actual animation begins, with compositing, editing, and putting the final touches on everything.\nStart Date: **10/03/22**\n\n# **TOTAL ASK:**\n**~Ξ320 or ($500K USD)** to fund the creation of Nouns! An Animated Pilot. \n*The ETH will be immediately converted to USDC to ensure we have funding to cover production costs.*\n\n**MULTISIG**\nThe proposed budget + Ξ1 to cover gas fees will be released in ETH to a 3 of 4 multisig with signers **JoelCares**, **ToadyHawk**, **Benbodhi** and **thepencil.eth**. The ETH will be immediately converted to USDC, and everything in excess of the original budget, minus 1 ETH to cover gas for the life of the multisig, will be returned to the DAO. If, due to high volatility, insufficient ETH is available to cover the proposed budget, a second proposal will top up the multisig at a later date.\n\n**Multisig address:**\n0x3D2268fa80B76448A8b33d554A3E972f5d8d5534\n\n**Phases to be funded at the commencement of each phase. Note that these are guidelines only and that a final determination will be made in collaboration with the person-place-thing-escrow multisig.*\n\nThe funds will go to pay for the following:\n\n**STAFF** \n- Writers \n- Casting Agents \n- Voice Actors \n- Audio Engineers \n- Storyboard Artists \n- Animatic Artists \n- Editors\n- Producers \n- Directors \n- Technical Director \n- Character Designers \n- Color Artists \n- Background Designers \n- Build Artists \n- Lead Animators \n- Production Animators \n- Compositors \n- Effects Artists \n- Retake Animators\n- Editors \n- Audio Engineers\n- Funding for music \n- Production Coordinators\n- Production Assistants to support artists, track assets and manage schedules\n\n**Software Licenses**\nSoftware to be used includes, but is not limited to: \n- Adobe Photoshop \n- Cinesync \n- Toonboom Harmony\n- Adobe After Effects \n\n# **Q&A:**\nSam and Jason will make themselves available for Q&A in the Nouns Discord and on a Nouners call if needed.\n\n**Q:** Why is this single episode $500K when the six episodes before came out to ~$333K each?\n \n**A:** When amortizing costs across multiple episodes of a season, the overall cost per episode decreases. Artists' short-term freelance rates are higher than longer-term employment rates. There are also discounts on software subscriptions for longer-term commitments.\n\n# **WHY IS THIS UNIQUE?**\nIn developing *Nouns! An Animated Series*, the mission of *Person Place Thing Studios* is to share, inspire, and empower people around the globe through CC0 storytelling.\n\nAs paid professionals in the animation space, we aim to modernize the animation studio and pipeline by no longer requiring industry talent to be tethered to an antiquated studio system, a specific geographic location, or a traditional network distribution model.\n\nWe plan to hire best-in-class artists and designers, make broadcast-quality Nounish content at an accelerated pace, and proliferate Nouns to a worldwide audience via the internet.\n\n# **WHAT IS THE TONE OF THE SHOW?**\n*Nouns! An Animated Series* draws from similar humor and animation quality as *The Regular Show* and *Adventure Time*.  We want to create shows that make us laugh!  Our cast of characters are goofballs!  They escalate simple situations into ridiculous adventures that are filled with unpredictable twists and turns. They rarely solve their problems but always end with a laugh!\n\n# **WHY SHOULD WE BACK THIS?**\n- Bringing Nouns to life through animation is the next leap in introducing these characters to the mainstream culture of all ages.\n- Distributing on Youtube, Twitter, Tiktok, etc, allows Nouns to reach an enormous audience.\n- Casting top talent as the voices of our characters will bring known celebrities to the world of Nouns and generate larger social media awareness and traditional media buzz.\n- Developing episodes in the 11-minute format also opens the door to legacy media distribution.\n\n# **BENEFITS TO THE DAO**\n- We love the Nouns characters and are dying to see them come to life!\n- Pilot episode will be CC0!\n- Cartoons are a great source of memeonic content; our show will create many shareable clips that can help with the mission of proliferation.\n- Cartoons are also a great invitation to a much wider and younger audience. \n- There will be new nounish content made and shared every day!\n- Having an animated show will add value to other extensions in the Nouns ecosystem.\n- Through Discord, the DAO will be an active participant in the creative process.\n- Any profits obtained will be reinvested in the studio to make additional Nouns animated content.\n- *Person Place Thing Studios* can be utilized in the creation of content for future DAO Proposals (episodic cartoons, commercial endeavors, music videos, shorts, etc)(i.e. The Greidiens pitch gets sold to a network, rather than having to shop around looking for a studio to work with we would already be set up to handle their needs.)\n- As educators, we will be inviting and sending the CC0 assets to schools for their students to use as they learn animation while creating nounish content.\n\n# **WHO ARE THE CREATIVES?**\n\n**Sam Ellis:**\nSam Ellis (Person) makes comics, cartoons, and games (Things) although he has also helped create a few people as well. He has worked for a myriad of comic publishers, animation, and game studios in a variety of positions from LA to Atlanta (Places). Some of his past projects have been: *Archer, Adventure Time, Bravest Warriors, The Awesomes, Frisky Dingo, Catbug*, and more.\n\n**Jason Shwartz:**\nJason Shwartz is an Emmy-nominated Director with extensive experience in broadcast television production and direction. He has directed broadcast shows for *Netflix, [adultswim], Comedy Central, Hulu, 20th Century Fox, SyFy, AppleTV, IFC, FX, and Disney*.  He has produced original animated content for social games with companies including *Disney Interactive, Marvel, ESPN, and Garfield*.\n\nJason has worked on popular television shows including *Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Wolfboy and the Everything Factory, Squidbillies, The Masked Singer, Paradise Police Department, Lazor Wulf, The Awesomes*, and more!\n\n**Previous accomplishments in the proliferation of Nouns:**\n- [Co-developed NounsTown, an extension project of Nouns introducing PFD (profile deeds) A profile picture that proves ownership of land in the metaverse](https://nounstown.wtf/), and a [Nouns Auction Tracker](https://nounstown.wtf/tracker).\n- Brought and showcased Nounish extensions into the metaverse via BLOCKS giving the ability to make user-generated content easy to share, such as 3D Nouns and other projects.\n- [Active Nouncil member that regularly participates in voting](https://nouncil.wtf/)\n- [Active participant and on the organizing committee for The Noun Square (A group of nounish builders hosting daily celebrations around Noun O’Clock)](https://twitter.com/noun_o_clock)\n- Introduced Samsung to Nouns (through Joey at Buoy Studio) which lead to their video in Times Square and 837X DCL experience.\n- [Prop 70 (CC0 Pitchbook)](https://nouns.wtf/vote/70)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Kamhh0c.jpg)\n\n# **PITCHBOOK:**\n*Below are attached parts of the pitchbook from Prop 70, we thought rather than attaching all the pages we would just attach a few.* \n**The outlines, character bios, and their designs will be further developed if funded.*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nPySACM.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/OOerzzy.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/n8f0qi3.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UDAn6Zw.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FtnmcAD.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pW3qMnG.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iSAAAiX.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0lvXKtH.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KFIPUSz.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/S4Y0uQl.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/v3tPsar.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pKfvpDI.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xvRZ4b4.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9TGaTG9.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0VVEX0M.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wd2ngDd.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HpaAM1z.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CuMar4K.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/m8NXn8N.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2U1AyiE.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gsEEIlO.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/eqrbhiM.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ua8N87m.png)",

An initiative that is comprehensive in nature, flexible in delivery, and aligned with specific wellbeing objectives that are drawn from global social and emotional wellness research. Combining our depth of experience in app development, education and content creation to deliver a remarkable outcome.\n\nWe have already created over 100 apps and wellness programs to great success, this will be our best of the best - an innovative, Noun branded mobile app for iOS and Android that will be an important support for kids when they need it most.\n\n## [](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-wellness-app-ios-android/1817#what-are-you-proposing-3)What Are You Proposing?\n\nNOUNS Wellness (name to be confirmed) is a mobile mental health app for the next generation. Using play and community spirit, kids are inspired and engaged with games and activities to actually practice mental health daily.\n\nThis proposal will cover details on how we can do this and why we are the team who can make this happen.\n\nAnd also how this initiative is more than a good idea…\n\nIt’s potentially the very essence that makes NOUNS nounish. And what we see is a perfect match to the mission to not only proliferate the NOUNS brand, but also the NOUNS’ mission of goodwill.\n\nLET’S GO!\n\n## [](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-wellness-app-ios-android/1817#why-are-you-doing-it-4)Why Are You Doing It?\n\nMental health has never been more important post pandemic…\n\n-   …And this time it’s the kids who are feeling the pressure, not just stressed out adults or Web3 degens. There are global stats that show some very alarming numbers with teen depression, anxiety and sadly suicides. There’s a lot to find wrong with the world, so activaley reminding, educating and inspiring young people has become integral to their wellbeing and their future.\n    \n-   Nouns Wellness will also have a natural ripple effect through our Web3 community. As part of the crypto culture, mental health is on everyone’s lips in Twitter Spaces and in Discord, but there has yet to be the wellness project to emerge and really connect with and serve the wider Web3 community.\n    \n-   Nouns is a project close to our hearts and we are aligned with what it represents. It excites us to see the diverse range of future collaborations and partnerships where we can proliferate the brand and its mission.\n    \n\n## [](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-wellness-app-ios-android/1817#why-nouns-5)Why Nouns?\n\nSomething that makes habits stick and fitness routines engaging is play and fun.\n\n-   As pioneers in transforming fitness education with play at its center, we saw immediately how a playful and fun brand like Nouns can boost the wellness conversation with young people.\n-   And at the same time boost the Nouns brand and positioning further, by activating real world engagement with Nouns and the super healthy benefits of a wellness practice.\n\nIn a word… Nouns will make wellness FUN. And Nouns are what wellness will look like for young kids. No-one is owning this wellness space for kids the way Nouns can.\n\n(Plus as a Web3 native brand Nouns open the door to the conversation with young people about NFTs and what the blockchain means to our future.)\n\n## [](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-wellness-app-ios-android/1817#how-is-this-different-to-whats-already-out-there-6)How Is This Different to What’s Already out There?\n\nThe go-to apps out there: Headspace, Calm and similar, are designed for adults.\n\nThey also only offer one type of mindfulness, (including ones for children) - guided experiences that are consumed in one direction. In our decades of experience with kids (and adults too) we have proven that interactive activities and playful tasks are game changers. Like moving your body with active play instead of reps on a gym mat.\n\nThis interactive approach is a major point of difference in the overall physical and mental wellbeing space. There are so many ways of doing wellbeing, but they’re not fun… Until NOUNS Wellness.\n\nAdditionally: The app source code we create will be open source and available for use by the Noun community.\n\n## [](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-wellness-app-ios-android/1817#who-is-the-audience-how-are-you-going-to-market-this-app-7)Who Is the Audience? How Are You Going to Market This App?\n\nAs established business owners and leaders in the fitness, education and wellness space, we have an active database of 45,000+ teachers, schools, fitness professionals and educators who are actively trusting and consuming everything we create. A recommendation from us to this audience will activate thousands of teachers and schools as users.\n\nAmong these people we also have strong and reliable partnerships to further amplify reach and engagement beyond the Web3 universe. Offering free, engaging and ‘cool’ resources for kids’ wellbeing is something these communities are hungry for.\n\nAdditionally our wellness podcast features interviews with olympians, human potential leaders, international sports personalities and even actors: Energetic Radio by Dale Sidebottom with 260 episodes, weekly releases and thousands of monthly listeners. We are also both regular speakers and have been on stages in 40+ countries. We will promote the app to our engaged social media channels and activate webinar style campaigns, so NOUNS can leverage our existing network and following.\n\nIn short it’s not our first rodeo, we are not a startup like many projects in the Web3 space. We are seeing a synergy between our experience, our existing client base and the Noun brand to elevate both for greater impact – creating the foundations of the future world that Web3 stands for and ideas this project believes in.\n\nWe also aim to place Nouns at the forefront of supporting the Web3 community who are battling with extreme emotions of the daily game of NFT’s and Crypto.\n\nBeyond this scope we believe Nouns could have wider appeal to the global issue of declining health and wellness. We see Nouns Wellness as contributing toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal Number 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.\n\n## [](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-wellness-app-ios-android/1817#whos-creating-it-8)Who’s Creating It?\n\nWe’re two dads from Australia, and we are also two highly successful Web2 startup founders who have been in crypto since 2017.
