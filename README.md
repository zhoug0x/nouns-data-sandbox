# nouns data sandbox

> data sandbox w/ scripts for querying the nouns subgraph via nodejs

run/edit the scripts in `/scripts` to update the JSON files in `/data`

to extend this, there's nice nouns subgraph query [examples here](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/blob/master/packages/nouns-webapp/src/wrappers/subgraph.ts)

run `yarn get-all` to fetch & update all the JSON data with latest data from the subgraph
